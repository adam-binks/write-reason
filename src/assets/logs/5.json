The aim of a shared space is to create a safer environment for pedestrians, and a more efficient journey for vehicles. The UK department for transport claims that these aims are met as a shared space 'reduces the dominance of motor vehicles', acting favourably towards pedestrians and increasing their safety. However, shared spaces also have negative impacts and inhabitants of urban areas can often oppose them.  ",

Evidence for this has been collected in the towns of Poynton and Bexleyheath, where the shared space scheme has been deemed as successful. A successful shared space also creates an environment which favours the safety of pedestrians. Because of this, when used correctly, it can have a positive impact. ",

These designs predominantly take place in an urban area which, according to National Geographic, is a developed location surrounding a city, including towns, cities and suburbs. The aim of a shared space is to create a safer environment for pedestrians, and a more efficient journey for vehicles. The UK department for transport claims that these aims are met as a shared space 'reduces the dominance of motor vehicles', acting favourably towards pedestrians and increasing their safety. However, shared spaces also have negative impacts and inhabitants of urban areas can often oppose them.  \n\nLocal populations can disagree that shared spaces should be promoted, due to the nature of their design. A common feature of this design is a lack of kerbing, which provides protection for pedestrians. Removing the kerb has led to pedestrians reporting a loss of 'safe space' when walking, shown through the Holmes Report on Shared Space. \n\nFor many pedestrians, the pavement is a barrier between themselves and the cars. Whilst losing this feature creates an overall sense of unease with the general pedestrian population, it has a heightened impact on children and people with disabilities. Those with disabilities, such as a vision impairment, are more vulnerable in shared space areas as they are unable to detect where the road starts and the pavement ends. The Women and Equalities Committee report, quotes a man with a disability stating that shared space schemes lead him to feel like 'second class citizen', due to the lack of division between himself and the road. \n\nThis lack of separation can also put children at risk, as they have not yet developed an understanding of road safety. Without a differentiation between the road and the pavement, their safety may be put at risk with children becoming confused and not checking for cars when crossing. It could be suggested that children have not been considered when designing shared spaces. With shared spaces relying on 'civility' and 'social cues', stated by the Project for Public Spaces, the layout requires skills which children have not yet acquired.  The Holmes Report on Shared Spaces provides evidence for this concern, as a parent records she “almost lost [her] young daughter,\n who ran into the path of a car\". \n\nHowever, the Shared Space theory suggests that having a fatal accident, when using a shared space, should not be a concern, given the speed that the cars travel at. According to the Urban Design Group, a shared space reduces the speed of vehicles, to a velocity where they are incapable of causing serious injuries to pedestrians, if a crash were to occur. Evidence for this has been collected in the towns of Poynton and Bexleyheath, where the shared space scheme has been deemed as successful.

Because of this, when used correctly, a shared space can have a positive impact. \n\nFurthermore, the report of Evaluation of Shared Space to reduce traffic congestion has found that vehicle travel times, in a shared space, have been reduced by 50% and delays by 66%. These figures show a positive impact on road users, as a result of a shared space. \n\nBut the positive impacts are perhaps outweighed by one report by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea pedestrian behaviour study. This research shows that a shared space road in South Kensington has seen in increase in the average road speed, from 22mph to 27mph.

These designs predominantly take place in an urban area which, according to National Geographic, is a developed location surrounding a city, including towns, cities and suburbs. The aim of a shared space is to create a safer environment for pedestrians, and a more efficient journey for vehicles. The UK department for transport claims that these aims are met as a shared space 'reduces the dominance of motor vehicles', acting favourably towards pedestrians and increasing their safety. However, shared spaces also have negative impacts and inhabitants of urban areas can often oppose them.  \n\nLocal populations can disagree that shared spaces should be promoted, due to the nature of their design. A common feature of this design is a lack of kerbing, which provides protection for pedestrians. Removing the kerb has led to pedestrians reporting a loss of 'safe space' when walking, shown through the Holmes Report on Shared Space. \n\nFor many pedestrians, the pavement is a barrier between themselves and the cars. Whilst losing this feature creates an overall sense of unease with the general pedestrian population, it has a heightened impact on children and people with disabilities. Those with disabilities, such as a vision impairment, are more vulnerable in shared space areas as they are unable to detect where the road starts and the pavement ends. The Women and Equalities Committee report, quotes a man with a disability stating that shared space schemes lead him to feel like 'second class citizen', due to the lack of division between himself and the road. \n\nThis lack of separation can also put children at risk, as they have not yet developed an understanding of road safety. Without a differentiation between the road and the pavement, their safety may be put at risk with children becoming confused and not checking for cars when crossing. It could be suggested that children have not been considered when designing shared spaces. With shared spaces relying on 'civility' and 'social cues', stated by the Project for Public Spaces, the layout requires skills which children have not yet acquired.  The Holmes Report on Shared Spaces provides evidence for this concern, as a parent records she “almost lost [her] young daughter,\n who ran into the path of a car\". \n\nHowever, the Shared Space theory suggests that having a fatal accident, when using a shared space, should not be a concern, given the speed that the cars travel at. According to the Urban Design Group, a shared space reduces the speed of vehicles, to a velocity where they are incapable of causing serious injuries to pedestrians, if a crash were to occur. Evidence for this has been collected in the towns of Poynton and Bexleyheath, where the shared space scheme has been deemed as successful. A successful shared space also creates an environment which favours the safety of pedestrians. Because of this, when used correctly, a shared space can have a positive impact. \n\nFurthermore, the report of Evaluation of Shared Space to reduce traffic congestion has found that vehicle travel times, in a shared space, have been reduced by 50% and delays by 66%. These figures show a positive impact on road users, as a result of a shared space. \n\nBut the positive impacts are perhaps outweighed by one report by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea pedestrian behaviour study. This research shows that a shared space road in South Kensington has seen in increase in the average road speed, from 22mph to 27mph.

These designs predominantly take place in an urban area which, according to National Geographic, is a developed location surrounding a city, including towns, cities and suburbs. The aim of a shared space is to create a safer environment for pedestrians, and a more efficient journey for vehicles. The UK department for transport claims that these aims are met as a shared space 'reduces the dominance of motor vehicles', acting favourably towards pedestrians and increasing their safety. However, shared spaces also have negative impacts and inhabitants of urban areas can often oppose them.  \n\nLocal populations can disagree that shared spaces should be promoted, due to the nature of their design. A common feature of this design is a lack of kerbing, which provides protection for pedestrians. Removing the kerb has led to pedestrians reporting a loss of 'safe space' when walking, shown through the Holmes Report on Shared Space. \n\nFor many pedestrians, the pavement is a barrier between themselves and the cars. Whilst losing this feature creates an overall sense of unease with the general pedestrian population, it has a heightened impact on children and people with disabilities. Those with disabilities, such as a vision impairment, are more vulnerable in shared space areas as they are unable to detect where the road starts and the pavement ends. The Women and Equalities Committee report, quotes a man with a disability stating that shared space schemes lead him to feel like 'second class citizen', due to the lack of division between himself and the road. \n\nThis lack of separation can also put children at risk, as they have not yet developed an understanding of road safety. Without a differentiation between the road and the pavement, their safety may be put at risk with children becoming confused and not checking for cars when crossing. It could be suggested that children have not been considered when designing shared spaces. With shared spaces relying on 'civility' and 'social cues', stated by the Project for Public Spaces, the layout requires skills which children have not yet acquired.  The Holmes Report on Shared Spaces provides evidence for this concern, as a parent records she “almost lost [her] young daughter,\n who ran into the path of a car\". \n\nHowever, Shared Space theory suggests that having a fatal accident, when using a shared space, should not be a concern, given the speed that the cars travel at. According to the Urban Design Group, a shared space reduces the speed of vehicles, to a velocity where they are incapable of causing serious injuries to pedestrians, if a crash were to occur.

              "content": "Shared space is redesigning roads so that pedestrians have authority over cars and other vehicles https://www.pps.org/article/what-is-shared-space. These designs take place in urban areas which, according to National Geographic, is a developed location surrounding a city. The UK department for transport claims that a shared space 'reduces the dominance of motor vehicles', acting favourably towards pedestrians and increasing their safety. However, inhabitants of urban areas can often oppose shared spaces. Local populations can disagree that shared spaces should be promoted, due to the nature of their design. A common feature of this design is a lack of kerbing, which provides protection for pedestrians. Removing the kerb has led to pedestrians reporting a loss of 'safe space' when walking, shown through the Holmes Report on Shared Space. For many pedestrians, the pavement is a barrier between themselves and the cars. Whilst losing this feature creates an overall sense of unease with the general pedestrian population, it has a heightened impact on children and people with disabilities. Those with disabilities, such as a vision impairment, are more vulnerable in shared space areas as they are unable to detect where the road starts and the pavement ends. The Women and Equalities Committee report, quotes a man with a disability stating that shared space schemes lead him to feel like 'second class citizen', due to the lack of division between himself and the road. This lack of separation can also put children at risk, as they have not yet developed an understanding of road safety. Without a differentiation between the road and the pavement, their safety may be put at risk with children becoming confused and not checking for cars when crossing. It could be suggested that children have not been considered when designing shared spaces. With shared spaces relying on 'civility' and 'social cues', stated by the Project for Public Spaces, the layout requires skills which children have not yet acquired.  The Holmes Report on Shared Spaces provides evidence for this concern, as a parent records she “almost lost [her] young daughter,\r who ran into the path of a car\". However, the Shared Space theory suggests that having a fatal accident, when using a shared space, should not be a concern, given the speed that the cars travel at. According to the Urban Design Group, a shared space reduces the speed of vehicles, to a velocity where they are incapable of causing serious injuries to pedestrians, if a crash were to occur. Evidence for this has been collected in the towns of Poynton and Bexleyheath, where the shared space scheme has been deemed as successful. A successful shared space also creates an environment which favours the safety of pedestrians. Because of this, when used correctly, a shared space can have a positive impact. Furthermore, the report of Evaluation of Shared Space to reduce traffic congestion has found that vehicle travel times, in a shared space, have been reduced by 50% and delays by 66%. These figures show a positive impact on road users, as a result of a shared space. But the positive impacts are perhaps outweighed by one report by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea pedestrian behaviour study. This research shows that a shared space road in South Kensington has seen in increase in the average road speed, from 22mph to 27mph. Given this dangerous increase, it is understandable that the Holmes Report states that a majority of 63% of shared space users, rated their experience as poor.",

              "content": "QUESTION: Should “shared spaces” in urban planning be promoted?\n\nShared space is a redesign of roads so that pedestrians have authority over cars and other vehicles. These designs predominantly take place in an urban area which, according to National Geographic, is a developed location surrounding a city, including towns, cities and suburbs. The aim of a shared space is to create a safer environment for pedestrians, and a more efficient journey for vehicles. The UK department for transport claims that these aims are met as a shared space 'reduces the dominance of motor vehicles', acting favourably towards pedestrians and increasing their safety. However, shared spaces also have negative impacts and inhabitants of urban areas can often oppose them.  \n\nLocal populations can disagree that shared spaces should be promoted, due to the nature of their design. A common feature of this design is a lack of kerbing, which provides protection for pedestrians. Removing the kerb has led to pedestrians reporting a loss of 'safe space' when walking, shown through the Holmes Report on Shared Space. \n\nFor many pedestrians, the pavement is a barrier between themselves and the cars. Whilst losing this feature creates an overall sense of unease with the general pedestrian population, it has a heightened impact on children and people with disabilities. Those with disabilities, such as a vision impairment, are more vulnerable in shared space areas as they are unable to detect where the road starts and the pavement ends. The Women and Equalities Committee report, quotes a man with a disability stating that shared space schemes lead him to feel like 'second class citizen', due to the lack of division between himself and the road. \n\nThis lack of separation can also put children at risk, as they have not yet developed an understanding of road safety. Without a differentiation between the road and the pavement, their safety may be put at risk with children becoming confused and not checking for cars when crossing. It could be suggested that children have not been considered when designing shared spaces. With shared spaces relying on 'civility' and 'social cues', stated by the Project for Public Spaces, the layout requires skills which children have not yet acquired.  The Holmes Report on Shared Spaces provides evidence for this concern, as a parent records she “almost lost [her] young daughter,\n who ran into the path of a car\". \n\nHowever, Shared Space theory suggests that having a fatal accident, when using a shared space, should not be a concern, given the speed that the cars travel at. According to the Urban Design Group, a shared space reduces the speed of vehicles, to a velocity where they are incapable of causing serious injuries to pedestrians, if a crash were to occur. Evidence for this has been collected in the towns of Poynton and Bexleyheath, where the shared space scheme has been deemed as successful. A successful shared space also creates an environment which favours the safety of pedestrians. Because of this, when used correctly, a shared space can have a positive impact. \n\nFurthermore, the report of Evaluation of Shared Space to reduce traffic congestion has found that vehicle travel times, in a shared space, have been reduced by 50% and delays by 66%. These figures show that the shared space has had a positive impact on road users, making their journeys quicker. \n\nBut these positives rely on the shared space being used correctly, with drivers respecting the rights of the pedestrians. When this is not followed, the positive impacts are perhaps outweighed by the negative. A report by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea pedestrian behaviour study, conducted research that showed  that a shared space road in South Kensington has seen an increase in the average road speed, from 22mph to 27mph. Given this dangerous increase, it is understandable that the Holmes Report states that a majority of 63% of shared space users, rated their experience as poor, and only 18% as good. \n\nThe Holmes report also highlights only 11% of respondents, at an incident, reporting an accident, calling into question the validity of any data that supports the use of shared spaces, with regards to the number of incidents. \n\nThis collection of research and statistics conclude that shared spaces can have a positive impact, mainly on road users, by decreasing travel times and, in theory, reducing the speed of vehicles. When used correctly, these factors support the installation of shared spaces within urban areas and planning. However, it is important to highlight the negative impacts the shared space can have, predominantly on the welfare of the pedestrians. With the aim of shared spaces being to promote pedestrian safety, it is justifiable to conclude that they can instead be subjected to an increased risk when using pavements in shared spaces, and therefore the promotion of shared spaces is not recommended. \n\nPlan - \n\nIntro - def. shared space/urban planning \n\nNo - Holmes report \n\nNo - Women and Equalities committee report \n\nYes - project for public spaces \n\nYes - UK department for transport and Evaluation of shared space to reduce traffic congestion \n\nConclusion - When used correctly \n\n",

With shared spaces relying on 'civility' and 'social cues', stated by the Project for Public Spaces, the layout requires skills which children have not yet acquired.

Evidence for this has been collected in the towns of Poynton and Bexleyheath, where the shared space scheme has been deemed as successful. A successful shared space also creates an environment which favours the safety of pedestrians. Because of this, when used correctly, a shared space can have a positive impact. ",

The UK department for transport claims that these aims are met as a shared space 'reduces the dominance of motor vehicles', acting favourably towards pedestrians and increasing their safety. However, shared spaces also have negative impacts and inhabitants of urban areas can often oppose them.  ",

With shared spaces relying on 'civility' and 'social cues', stated by the Project for Public Spaces, the layout requires skills which children have not yet acquired.

Evidence for this has been collected in the towns of Poynton and Bexleyheath, where the shared space scheme has been deemed as successful. A successful shared space also creates an environment which favours the safety of pedestrians. Because of this, when used correctly, a shared space can have a positive impact. ",

When used correctly, these factors support the installation of shared spaces within urban areas and planning. However, it is important to highlight the negative impacts the shared space can have, predominantly on the welfare of the pedestrians. With the aim of shared spaces being to promote pedestrian safety, it is justifiable to conclude that they can instead be subjected to an increased risk when using pavements in shared spaces, and therefore the promotion of shared spaces is not recommended.

Those with disabilities, such as a vision impairment, are more vulnerable in shared space areas as they are unable to detect where the road starts and the pavement ends. The Women and Equalities Committee report, quotes a man with a disability stating that shared space schemes lead him to feel like 'second class citizen', due to the lack of division between himself and the road.

With shared spaces relying on 'civility' and 'social cues', stated by the Project for Public Spaces, the layout requires skills which children have not yet acquired.  The Holmes Report on Shared Spaces provides evidence for this concern, as a parent records she “almost lost [her] young daughter,\r who ran into the path of a car\". ",

Evidence for this has been collected in the towns of Poynton and Bexleyheath, where the shared space scheme has been deemed as successful. A successful shared space also creates an environment which favours the safety of pedestrians. Because of this, when used correctly, it can have a positive impact. ",
