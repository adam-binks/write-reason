This essay will explore the pros and cons of the shared place and introduce why such polar rating happens.\n\n## Definition\nUK department of transport defines it as \"a design approach that seeks to change the way streets operate by reducing the dominance of motor vehicles, primarily through lower speeds encouraging drivers to behave more accommodatingly towards pedestrians\", but SWOV defines it as creation and design of residential areas, which gives the shared space a limitation: \"located in residential areas\".  By those definitions,  the use of the shared place saves space and makes a diversification street view. But the behaviour of putting cars and pedestrians together produces a more dangerous condition.\n\n## Functions\nThere are three purposes for the reason that planning the shared space in urban design. First, it may reduce vehicles' speed and decrease the traffic accident rate. The decrease of severe and fatal injuries in the shared space located on the Poyton and Bexleyheath high street does support the design. Such limitation does not last for a long time. Since now, the limitation of the speed has increased from 22 (in 2013) to 27, where the accident rate may rise due to such increase. Next, the shared space will save space for the non-traffic functions. Since pedestrians and transportations use the same space, it allows a better experience for driver customers and does decrease the distance for pedestrians to take the taxi. Finally, it can change modes of transport easily with the help of the second point above. By researching the shared space in West Virginia University's Downtown campus, shared space saves 50% time for vehicles but delays 66% in the worst condition.\n\n## Experience\nThe feedback on using the shared space is quite negative.  Urban design group evaluate the design as a bad design, where such design adversely affects others. The feedback from the Holmes Report is mostly poor. An interviewee describes the shared space as \"losing the sense of 'Safe' place\". He describes the shared space as a dangerous place for kids: youngs can run to the middle of the road and . Similar rating from Michael Broderick complains that the shared space as 'have no comfort' and criticise the 'shared space' is unfriendly to disabled. Rating from Urban design group also criticises such design as a bad design. The group describes the design as it affects others and does not protect pedestrians since pedestrians need more help than transportation needs.\n\n## Classic crosswalks\nThe design of the crossway uses road markers to divide the street without affecting pedestrians to cross the street. Such design persuades pedestrians and vehicles to cross the street by the notice of the street marker and traffic lights. Project for Public Spaces describes the crosswalks as it effectively banning them from crossing at any other\n places.\n\n## Conclusion\nShared space should not be prompt. Firstly, the space that shared space saved for transportation is not more valuable than the increased danger that the shared space causes. In contradiction, the traditional crossway persuades pedestrians and vehicles to take care of each other. Next, the shared space does not protect the weaker one between the vehicle and pedestrians. Finally, shared space is not friendly to all kinds of people.\n\nspace' makes her feels like a second class citizen.\n\n",

UK department of transport defines it as \"a design approach that seeks to change the way streets operate by reducing the dominance of motor vehicles, primarily through lower speeds encouraging drivers to behave more accommodatingly towards pedestrians\", but SWOV defines it as creation and design of residential areas, which gives the shared space a limitation: \"located in residential areas\".FunctionThere are three purposes that are planning the shared space in urban design. First, it may reduce the vehicle speed. The decrease of serious and fatal injuries in the shared space located on the Poyton and Bexleyheath high street does support the design. However, limitation of the speed has increased from 22 (in 2013) to 27, where the accident rate may rise up due to such increase. Next, the shared space will save space for the non-traffic functions. Finally, it can change modes of transport easily with the help of the second point above.ExperienceThe feedback on using the shared space is quite negative.  Urban design group evaluate the design as a bad design, where such design adversely affects others. The feedback from Holmes Report is mostly poor, an interviewee describes the shared space as \"losing sense of 'Safe' place\". Shared space is unfriendly to the disabled too. Michael Broderick complains the shared space as 'have no comfort' and criticise the 'shared space' makes her feels like a second class citizen.",

                  "longText": "There are three purposes that planning the shared space in the urban design. First, it may reduce the vehicle speed. The decrease of serious and fatal injuries in the shared space which located on the Poyton and Bexleyheath high street does support the design. However, limitation of the speed has increased from 22 (in 2013) to 27, where the accident rate may rise up due to such increase. Next, shared space will save space for the non-traffic functions. Finally, it can change modes of transport easily with the help of the second point above.",

However, limitation of the speed has increased from 22 (in 2013) to 27, where the accident rate may rise due to such increase. Next, the shared space will save space for the non-traffic functions.

However, limitation of the speed has increased from 22 (in 2013) to 27, where the accident rate may rise up due to such increase. Next, shared space will save space for the non-traffic functions. Finally, it can change modes of transport easily with the help of the second point above.",

First, it may reduce vehicles' speed and decrease the traffic accident rate. The decrease of severe and fatal injuries in the shared space located on the Poyton and Bexleyheath high street does support the design. Such limitation does not last for a long time. Since now, the limitation of the speed has increased from 22 (in 2013) to 27, where the accident rate may rise due to such increase. Next, the shared space will save space for the non-traffic functions. Since pedestrians and transportations use the same space, it allows a better experience for driver customers and does decrease the distance for pedestrians to take the taxi. Finally, it can change modes of transport easily with the help of the second point above. By researching the shared space in West Virginia University's Downtown campus, shared space saves 50% time for vehicles but delays 66% in the worst condition.",

As the definition from the UK department of transport, drivers will be encouraged to lower their speed. The decrease of severe and fatal injuries in the shared space located on the Poyton and Bexleyheath high street does support the design. Nevertheless, such a limitation does not last for a long time. Since now, the limitation of the speed has increased from 22 (in 2013) to 27, where the accident rate may rise due to such increase. Next, the shared space will save space for the non-traffic functions. Since pedestrians and transportations use the same space, it allows a better experience for driver customers and does decrease the distance for pedestrians to take the taxi. Finally, it can change modes of transport easily with the help of the second point above. By researching the shared space in West Virginia University's Downtown campus, shared space saves 50% time for vehicles but delays 66% in the worst condition.",
