  "preTaskSubmission": "{\"q1\":\"I aim to produce a piece of writing that shows a balance of reading and secondary resources combined with my reflections and thoughts to show evaluation of these resources in response to the set question. I aim to make each paragraph suitably link to the next and that my conclusion and introduction are effective and not just repetitions of each other. \",\"q2\":\"Firstly, a good essay needs to have the basic requirements for structure: correct font size, title page, student number, justified margins. Second, the referencing style needs to be correct. Finally, I find that the actual content of my essays varies a lot - good essays for me usually include primary quotations from set texts along with plenty of cited or quoted secondary reading, and then my own conclusions that are drawn from these ideas. An essay introduction needs to explore the essay question or topic and then the conclusion needs to sum up your main ideas and perhaps provide an overall answer. Paragraphs need to flow together neatly and consistently and wording, grammar and spelling needs to be correct. \",\"q3\":\"Researching the background and plan for an essay is what helps me understand the topic or primary text more  and gives me a lot of ideas for what to actually include in the essay. Writing the essay itself allows me to better set out and structure my thoughts in a clear way. I also think that the more essays you write, the more feedback from lecturers you get which you can then take on and use to improve future essays. Essays are a good way to be assigned marks or grades because they pull together a main topic from your module and ensure you reflect what you have learned, understood and gone on to do individual research.on. \"}",

Now, an international group of independent biohackers claim to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use.

In this essay, I will explore the benefits and disadvantages of the effect of greater regulatory control over genetic biohacking. \n\n## Benefits\nFirst of all, it cannot be denied that independent biohacking has resulted in plenty of research into the development of new drugs and potential lifesaving cures for people with serious health conditions and who cannot wait for the current sometimes 10-year federal drug development and approval process. One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Recently, an international group of independent biohackers claim to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. \n\n## Ethical necessities \nFurthermore, the current lack of any sort of universal government-official ethical regulations whatsoever on the practice of biohacking leaves room for the misuse of genetic experimentation. According Science Journal, \"private actors may not be inclined to regulate conduct that poses few risks to them, even if safety risks to others are numerous, obvious and serious.\" Although it is true that some biohacking groups have created their own ethics restrictions and safety policies that may help to avoid negative side-effects such as harm to public health, overall there are little to no ethical guidelines for the amateurs and individuals who practice biotechnology. However small the potential is for the development of material that could result in bioterrorism may be, the fact that there are no official rules and regulations to further restrict that is very dangerous. As such, greater regulatory and ethical control over genetic biohacking is necessary to ensure that the possibility of misuse of biotechnology research that could harm public health is restricted by law as much as possible. \n\n",

However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. \n\nFurthermore, the current lack of any sort of universal government-official ethical regulations whatsoever on the practice of biohacking leaves room for the misuse of genetic experimentation. Even now, gene therapy products designed for self-administration are being sold to the public, despite the fact that the sale of these products is illegal as stated by FDA law. According Science Journal, \"private actors may not be inclined to regulate conduct that poses few risks to them, even if safety risks to others are numerous, obvious and serious.\" Although it is true that some biohacking groups have created their own ethics restrictions and safety policies that may help to avoid negative side-effects such as harm to public health, overall there are little to no ethical guidelines for the amateurs and individuals who practice biotechnology.

In this essay, I will explore the benefits and disadvantages of the effect of greater regulatory control over genetic biohacking. \n\nFirst of all, it cannot be denied that independent biohacking has resulted in plenty of research into the development of new drugs and potential lifesaving cures for people with serious health conditions and who cannot wait for the current sometimes 10-year federal drug development and approval process. One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Recently, an international group of independent biohackers claim to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. \n\nFurthermore, the current lack of any sort of universal government-official ethical regulations whatsoever on the practice of biohacking leaves room for the misuse of genetic experimentation. Even now, gene therapy products designed for self-administration are being sold to the public, despite the fact that the sale of these products is illegal due to safety risks as stated by FDA law. According Science Journal, \"private actors may not be inclined to regulate conduct that poses few risks to them, even if safety risks to others are numerous, obvious and serious.\" Although it is true that some biohacking groups have created their own ethics restrictions and safety policies that may help to avoid negative side-effects such as harm to public health, overall there are little to no ethical guidelines for the amateurs and individuals who practice biotechnology. However small the potential is for the development of material that could result in bioterrorism may be, the fact that there are no official rules and regulations to further restrict that is very dangerous.

Reasoning behind this practice can range from attempting to bypass the bureaucracy involved in receiving federal approval for medical treatments to discovering cheaper alternatives to million-dollar drug therapies. \n\nUnfortunately, according to Daniel Gerstein, a senior policy analyst at RAND, \"biotechnology...has great potential for human good, but also has the possibility to be misused.\" \n\nAt the moment, there is very little government official regulation with regards to the practice of biohacking. This not only minimises the legitimacy and validity of biohacking research and findings, but also creates the opportunity for potential catastrophic gene editing disasters. In this essay, I will explore the benefits and disadvantages of the effect of greater regulatory control over genetic biohacking. \n\nFirst of all, it cannot be denied that independent biohacking has resulted in plenty of research into the development of new drugs and potential lifesaving cures for people with serious health conditions and who cannot wait for the current sometimes 10-year federal drug development and approval process. One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Recently, an international group of independent biohackers claim to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. \n\nFurthermore, the current lack of any sort of universal government-official ethical regulations whatsoever on the practice of biohacking leaves room for the misuse of genetic experimentation. Even now, gene therapy products designed for self-administration are being sold to the public, despite the fact that the sale of these products is illegal due to safety risks as stated by FDA law. According Science Journal, \"private actors may not be inclined to regulate conduct that poses few risks to them, even if safety risks to others are numerous, obvious and serious.\" Although it is true that some biohacking groups have created their own ethics restrictions and safety policies that may help to avoid negative side-effects such as harm to public health, overall there are little to no ethical guidelines for the amateurs and individuals who practice biotechnology.

However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. \n\nFurthermore, the current lack of any sort of universal government-official ethical regulations whatsoever on the practice of biohacking leaves room for the misuse of genetic experimentation. Even now, gene therapy products designed for self-administration are being sold to the public, despite the fact that the sale of these products is illegal due to safety risks as stated by FDA law. According Science Journal, \"private actors may not be inclined to regulate conduct that poses few risks to them, even if safety risks to others are numerous, obvious and serious.\" Although it is true that some biohacking groups have created their own ethics restrictions and safety policies that may help to avoid negative side-effects such as harm to public health, overall there are little to no ethical guidelines for the amateurs and individuals who practice biotechnology. However small the potential is for the development of material that could result in bioterrorism may be, the fact that there are no official rules and regulations to further restrict that is very dangerous. As such, greater regulatory and ethical control over genetic biohacking is necessary to ensure that the possibility of misuse of biotechnology research that could harm public health is further restricted as much as possible. \n\nHowever, it is important to recognise that due to the fact that independent biohacking practices are such a new branch of scientific research, developing universal guidelines and creating restrictive boundaries for this area would be very difficult. There is a need for more research and understanding by separate authorities and regulatory organisations into biotechnology in order to create suitable and specific policies and guidelines for biohackers and biohacking groups to adhere to so as to maximise public safety. \n\nThere is also the concern that the creation of strict regulations over genetic biohacking could prevent the maximisation of research and discovery possibilities of using biotechnology. In the example of Matt Might, a professor of computer engineering who worked with physicians for years to try and find some kind of diagnosis for his son who had a rare genetic disease. Through this independent research, Might succeeded in creating a community of families with children who possessed similar symptoms and thus helped scientists to discover how to more accurately diagnose this genetic disease. If greater regulatory control was imposed upon independent biohacking, scientific breakthroughs and discoveries such as this could be harder to achieve or even prevented. \n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that there is no perfect solution to the topic of greater regulatory control over genetic biohacking. On the one hand, research by independent biotechnology communities could result in cheaper and faster life-saving drug therapy treatment for patients suffering with genetic diseases. With more regulations, the legitimacy and effectiveness of these treatments could be validated and therefore more widely distributed to save more people. Moreover, the implementation of international ethical guidelines for biohacking would reduce the chances of experimental genetic disasters and restrict any potential harm to public safety. On the other hand, genetic biohacking is such a vast and new topic that creating any official regulations or policies would be a long, complicated process. There is also the possibility that official governmental control over biohacking could prevent more life-saving discoveries. Overall, it can be argued that there is a need for some form of greater regulatory control  over genetic biohacking, yet creating and enforcing this control \n\n",

              "content": "Genetic biohacking is the relatively recent scientific phenomenon which involves individuals - amateur biologists for example - with little formal scientific training independently performing  molecular genetic experiments outside of institutional laboratories. Reasoning behind this practice can range from attempting to bypass the bureaucracy involved in receiving federal approval for medical treatments to discovering cheaper alternatives to million-dollar drug therapies. \n\nUnfortunately, according to Daniel Gerstein, a senior policy analyst at RAND, \"biotechnology...has great potential for human good, but also has the possibility to be misused.\" \n\nAt the moment, there is very little government official regulation with regards to the practice of biohacking. This not only minimises the legitimacy and validity of biohacking research and findings, but also creates the opportunity for potential catastrophic gene editing disasters. In this essay, I will explore the benefits and disadvantages of the effect of greater regulatory control over genetic biohacking. \n\nFirst of all, it cannot be denied that independent biohacking has resulted in plenty of research into the development of new drugs and potential lifesaving cures for people with serious health conditions and who cannot wait for the current sometimes 10-year federal drug development and approval process. One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Recently, an international group of independent biohackers claim to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. \n\nFurthermore, the current lack of any sort of universal government-official ethical regulations whatsoever on the practice of biohacking leaves room for the misuse of genetic experimentation. Even now, gene therapy products designed for self-administration are being sold to the public, despite the fact that the sale of these products is illegal due to safety risks as stated by FDA law. According Science Journal, \"private actors may not be inclined to regulate conduct that poses few risks to them, even if safety risks to others are numerous, obvious and serious.\" Although it is true that some biohacking groups have created their own ethics restrictions and safety policies that may help to avoid negative side-effects such as harm to public health, overall there are little to no ethical guidelines for the amateurs and individuals who practice biotechnology. However small the potential is for the development of material that could result in bioterrorism may be, the fact that there are no official rules and regulations to further restrict that is very dangerous. As such, greater regulatory and ethical control over genetic biohacking is necessary to ensure that the possibility of misuse of biotechnology research that could harm public health is further restricted as much as possible. \n\nHowever, it is important to recognise that due to the fact that independent biohacking practices are such a new branch of scientific research, developing universal guidelines and creating restrictive boundaries for this area would be very difficult. There is a need for more research and understanding by separate authorities and regulatory organisations into biotechnology in order to create suitable and specific policies and guidelines for biohackers and biohacking groups to adhere to so as to maximise public safety. \n\nThere is also the concern that the creation of strict regulations over genetic biohacking could prevent the maximisation of research and discovery possibilities of using biotechnology. In the example of Matt Might, a professor of computer engineering who worked with physicians for years to try and find some kind of diagnosis for his son who had a rare genetic disease. Through this independent research, Might succeeded in creating a community of families with children who possessed similar symptoms and thus helped scientists to discover how to more accurately diagnose this genetic disease.

However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. \n\nFurthermore, the current lack of any sort of universal government-official ethical regulations whatsoever on the practice of biohacking leaves room for the misuse of genetic experimentation. Even now, gene therapy products designed for self-administration are being sold to the public, despite the fact that the sale of these products is illegal due to safety risks as stated by FDA law. According Science Journal, \"private actors may not be inclined to regulate conduct that poses few risks to them, even if safety risks to others are numerous, obvious and serious.\" Although it is true that some biohacking groups have created their own ethics restrictions and safety policies that may help to avoid negative side-effects such as harm to public health, overall there are little to no ethical guidelines for the amateurs and individuals who practice biotechnology. However small the potential is for the development of material that could result in bioterrorism may be, the fact that there are no official rules and regulations to further restrict that is very dangerous. As such, greater regulatory and ethical control over genetic biohacking is necessary to ensure that the possibility of misuse of biotechnology research that could harm public health is further restricted as much as possible. \n\nHowever, it is important to recognise that due to the fact that independent biohacking practices are such a new branch of scientific research, developing universal guidelines and creating restrictive boundaries for this area would be very difficult. There is a need for more research and understanding by separate authorities and regulatory organisations into biotechnology in order to create suitable and specific policies and guidelines for biohackers and biohacking groups to adhere to so as to maximise public safety. \n\nThere is also the concern that the creation of strict regulations over genetic biohacking could prevent the maximisation of research and discovery possibilities of using biotechnology. In the example of Matt Might, a professor of computer engineering who worked with physicians for years to try and find some kind of diagnosis for his son who had a rare genetic disease. Through this independent research, Might succeeded in creating a community of families with children who possessed similar symptoms and thus helped scientists to discover how to more accurately diagnose this genetic disease. If greater regulatory control was imposed upon independent biohacking, scientific breakthroughs and discoveries such as this could be harder to achieve or even prevented. \n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that there is no perfect solution to the topic of greater regulatory control over genetic biohacking. On the one hand, research by independent biotechnology communities could result in cheaper and faster life-saving drug therapy treatment for patients suffering with genetic diseases. With more regulations, the legitimacy and effectiveness of these treatments could be validated and therefore more widely distributed to save more people. Moreover, the implementation of international ethical guidelines for biohacking would reduce the chances of experimental genetic disasters and restrict any potential harm to public safety. On the other hand, genetic biohacking is such a vast and new topic that creating any official regulations or policies would be a long, complicated process. There is also the possibility that official governmental control over biohacking could prevent more life-saving discoveries. Overall, it can be argued that there is a need for some form of greater regulatory control  over genetic biohacking, yet creating and enforcing any form of control will be challenging. \n\n",

              "content": "Genetic biohacking is the relatively recent scientific phenomenon which involves individuals - amateur biologists for example - with little formal scientific training independently performing  molecular genetic experiments outside of institutional laboratories. Reasoning behind this practice can range from attempting to bypass the bureaucracy involved in receiving federal approval for medical treatments to discovering cheaper alternatives to million-dollar drug therapies. \n\nUnfortunately, according to Daniel Gerstein, a senior policy analyst at RAND, \"biotechnology...has great potential for human good, but also has the possibility to be misused.\" \n\nAt the moment, there is very little government official regulation with regards to the practice of biohacking. This not only minimises the legitimacy and validity of biohacking research and findings, but also creates the opportunity for potential catastrophic gene editing disasters. In this essay, I will explore the benefits and disadvantages of the effect of greater regulatory control over genetic biohacking. \n\nFirst of all, it cannot be denied that independent biohacking has resulted in plenty of research into the development of new drugs and potential lifesaving cures for people with serious health conditions and who cannot wait for the current sometimes 10-year federal drug development and approval process. One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Recently, an international group of independent biohackers claim to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. \n\nFurthermore, the current lack of any sort of universal government-official ethical regulations whatsoever on the practice of biohacking leaves room for the misuse of genetic experimentation. Even now, gene therapy products designed for self-administration are being sold to the public, despite the fact that the sale of these products is illegal due to safety risks as stated by FDA law. According Science Journal, \"private actors may not be inclined to regulate conduct that poses few risks to them, even if safety risks to others are numerous, obvious and serious.\" Although it is true that some biohacking groups have created their own ethics restrictions and safety policies that may help to avoid negative side-effects such as harm to public health, overall there are little to no ethical guidelines for the amateurs and individuals who practice biotechnology. However small the potential is for the development of material that could result in bioterrorism may be, the fact that there are no official rules and regulations to further restrict that is very dangerous. As such, greater regulatory and ethical control over genetic biohacking is necessary to ensure that the possibility of misuse of biotechnology research that could harm public health is further restricted as much as possible. \n\nHowever, it is important to recognise that due to the fact that independent biohacking practices are such a new branch of scientific research, developing universal guidelines and creating restrictive boundaries for this area would be very difficult. There is a need for more research and understanding by separate authorities and regulatory organisations into biotechnology in order to create suitable and specific policies and guidelines for biohackers and biohacking groups to adhere to so as to maximise public safety. \n\nThere is also the concern that the creation of strict regulations over genetic biohacking could prevent the maximisation of research and discovery possibilities of using biotechnology. In the example of Matt Might, a professor of computer engineering who worked with physicians for years to try and find some kind of diagnosis for his son who had a rare genetic disease. Through this independent research, Might succeeded in creating a community of families with children who possessed similar symptoms and thus helped scientists to discover how to more accurately diagnose this genetic disease.

However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. \n\nFurthermore, the current lack of any sort of universal government-official ethical regulations whatsoever on the practice of biohacking leaves room for the misuse of genetic experimentation. Even now, gene therapy products designed for self-administration are being sold to the public, despite the fact that the sale of these products is illegal due to safety risks as stated by FDA law. According Science Journal, \"private actors may not be inclined to regulate conduct that poses few risks to them, even if safety risks to others are numerous, obvious and serious.\" Although it is true that some biohacking groups have created their own ethics restrictions and safety policies that may help to avoid negative side-effects such as harm to public health, overall there are little to no ethical guidelines for the amateurs and individuals who practice biotechnology. However small the potential is for the development of material that could result in bioterrorism may be, the fact that there are no official rules and regulations to further restrict that is very dangerous. As such, greater regulatory and ethical control over genetic biohacking is necessary to ensure that the possibility of misuse of biotechnology research that could harm public health is further restricted as much as possible. \n\nHowever, it is important to recognise that due to the fact that independent biohacking practices are such a new branch of scientific research, developing universal guidelines and creating restrictive boundaries for this area would be very difficult. There is a need for more research and understanding by separate authorities and regulatory organisations into biotechnology in order to create suitable and specific policies and guidelines for biohackers and biohacking groups to adhere to so as to maximise public safety. \n\nThere is also the concern that the creation of strict regulations over genetic biohacking could prevent the maximisation of research and discovery possibilities of using biotechnology. In the example of Matt Might, a professor of computer engineering who worked with physicians for years to try and find some kind of diagnosis for his son who had a rare genetic disease. Through this independent research, Might succeeded in creating a community of families with children who possessed similar symptoms and thus helped scientists to discover how to more accurately diagnose this genetic disease. If greater regulatory control was imposed upon independent biohacking, scientific breakthroughs and discoveries such as this could be harder to achieve or even prevented. \n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that there is no perfect solution to the topic of greater regulatory control over genetic biohacking. On the one hand, research by independent biotechnology communities could result in cheaper and faster life-saving drug therapy treatment for patients suffering with genetic diseases. With more regulations, the legitimacy and effectiveness of these treatments could be validated and therefore more widely distributed to save more people. Moreover, the implementation of international ethical guidelines for biohacking would reduce the chances of experimental genetic disasters and restrict any potential harm to public safety. On the other hand, genetic biohacking is such a vast and new topic that creating any official regulations or policies would be a long, complicated process. There is also the possibility that official governmental control over biohacking could prevent more life-saving discoveries. Overall, it can be argued that there is a need for some form of greater regulatory control  over genetic biohacking, yet creating and enforcing any form of control will be challenging. \n\n",

              "content": "Genetic biohacking is the relatively recent scientific phenomenon which involves individuals - amateur biologists for example - with little formal scientific training independently performing  molecular genetic experiments outside of institutional laboratories. Reasoning behind this practice can range from attempting to bypass the bureaucracy involved in receiving federal approval for medical treatments to discovering cheaper alternatives to million-dollar drug therapies. \n\nUnfortunately, according to Daniel Gerstein, a senior policy analyst at RAND, \"biotechnology...has great potential for human good, but also has the possibility to be misused.\" \n\nAt the moment, there is very little government official regulation with regards to the practice of biohacking. This not only minimises the legitimacy and validity of biohacking research and findings, but also creates the opportunity for potential catastrophic gene editing disasters. In this essay, I will explore the benefits and disadvantages of the effect of greater regulatory control over genetic biohacking. \n\nFirst of all, it cannot be denied that independent biohacking has resulted in plenty of research into the development of new drugs and potential lifesaving cures for people with serious health conditions and who cannot wait for the current sometimes 10-year federal drug development and approval process. One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Recently, an international group of independent biohackers claim to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. \n\nFurthermore, the current lack of any sort of universal government-official ethical regulations whatsoever on the practice of biohacking leaves room for the misuse of genetic experimentation. Even now, gene therapy products designed for self-administration are being sold to the public, despite the fact that the sale of these products is illegal due to safety risks as stated by FDA law. According Science Journal, \"private actors may not be inclined to regulate conduct that poses few risks to them, even if safety risks to others are numerous, obvious and serious.\" Although it is true that some biohacking groups have created their own ethics restrictions and safety policies that may help to avoid negative side-effects such as harm to public health, overall there are little to no ethical guidelines for the amateurs and individuals who practice biotechnology. However small the potential is for the development of material that could result in bioterrorism may be, the fact that there are no official rules and regulations to further restrict that is very dangerous. As such, greater regulatory and ethical control over genetic biohacking is necessary to ensure that the possibility of misuse of biotechnology research that could harm public health is further restricted as much as possible. \n\nHowever, it is important to recognise that due to the fact that independent biohacking practices are such a new branch of scientific research, developing universal guidelines and creating restrictive boundaries for this area would be very difficult. There is a need for more research and understanding by separate authorities and regulatory organisations into biotechnology in order to create suitable and specific policies and guidelines for biohackers and biohacking groups to adhere to so as to maximise public safety. \n\nThere is also the concern that the creation of strict regulations over genetic biohacking could prevent the maximisation of research and discovery possibilities of using biotechnology. In the example of Matt Might, a professor of computer engineering who worked with physicians for years to try and find some kind of diagnosis for his son who had a rare genetic disease. Through this independent research, Might succeeded in creating a community of families with children who possessed similar symptoms and thus helped scientists to discover how to more accurately diagnose this genetic disease.

Recently, an international group of independent biohackers claimed to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. \n\nFurthermore, the current lack of any sort of universal government-official ethical regulations whatsoever on the practice of biohacking leaves room for the misuse of genetic experimentation. Even now, gene therapy products designed for self-administration are being sold to the public, despite the fact that the sale of these products is illegal due to safety risks as stated by FDA law. According Science Journal, \"private actors may not be inclined to regulate conduct that poses few risks to them, even if safety risks to others are numerous, obvious and serious.\" Although it is true that some biohacking groups have created their own ethics restrictions and safety policies that may help to avoid negative side-effects such as harm to public health, overall there are little to no ethical guidelines for the amateurs and individuals who practice biotechnology. However small the potential is for the development of material that could result in bioterrorism may be, the fact that there are no official rules and regulations to further restrict that is very dangerous. As such, greater regulatory and ethical control over genetic biohacking is necessary to ensure that the possibility of misuse of biotechnology research that could harm public health is further restricted as much as possible. \n\nHowever, it is important to recognise that due to the fact that independent biohacking practices are such a new branch of scientific research, developing universal guidelines and creating restrictive boundaries for this area would be very difficult. There is a need for more research and understanding by separate authorities and regulatory organisations into biotechnology in order to create suitable and specific policies and guidelines for biohackers and biohacking groups to adhere to so as to maximise public safety. \n\nThere is also the concern that the creation of strict regulations over genetic biohacking could prevent the maximisation of research and discovery possibilities of using biotechnology. For example, Matt Might, a professor of computer engineering, worked with physicians for years to try and find some kind of diagnosis for his son who had a rare genetic disease. Thanks to this independent research, Might succeeded in creating a community of families with children who possessed similar symptoms and through this he helped scientists discover how to more accurately diagnose the genetic disease. If greater regulatory control was imposed upon independent biohacking, scientific breakthroughs and discoveries such as this could be harder to achieve or even prevented. \n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that there is no perfect solution to the topic of greater regulatory control over genetic biohacking. On the one hand, research by independent biotechnology communities could result in cheaper and faster life-saving drug therapy treatment for patients suffering with genetic diseases. With more regulations, the legitimacy and effectiveness of these treatments could be validated and therefore more widely distributed to save more people. Moreover, the implementation of international ethical guidelines for biohacking would reduce the chances of experimental genetic disasters and restrict any potential harm to public safety. On the other hand, genetic biohacking is such a vast and new topic that creating any official regulations or policies would be a long, complicated process. There is also the possibility that official governmental control over biohacking could prevent more life-saving discoveries. Overall, it can be argued that there is a need for some form of greater regulatory control over genetic biohacking, yet creating and enforcing any form of control will be challenging. \n\n",

One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Now, an international group of independent biohackers claim to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking ",

One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Now, an international group of independent biohackers claim to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking ",

One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Now, an international group of independent biohackers claim to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. ",

                  "longText": "First of all, it cannot be denied that independent amateur biohacking has resulted in plenty of research into the development of new drugs and potential lifesaving cures for people with serious health conditions and who cannot wait for the current sometimes 10-year federal drug development and approval process. One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Now, an international group of independent biohackers claim to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. ",

One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Recently, an international group of independent biohackers claim to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. ",

However small the potential is for the development of material that could result in bioterrorism may be, the fact that there are no official rules and regulations to further restrict that is very dangerous. As such, greater regulatory and ethical control over genetic biohacking is necessary to ensure that the possibility of misuse of biotechnology research that could harm public health is restricted by law as much as possible.

One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Recently, an international group of independent biohackers claim to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. ",

According Science Journal, \"private actors may not be inclined to regulate conduct that poses few risks to them, even if safety risks to others are numerous, obvious and serious.\" Although it is true that some biohacking groups have created their own ethics restrictions and safety policies that may help to avoid negative side-effects such as harm to public health, overall there are little to no ethical guidelines for the amateurs and individuals who practice biotechnology. However small the potential is for the development of material that could result in bioterrorism may be, the fact that there are no official rules and regulations to further restrict that is very dangerous. As such, greater regulatory and ethical control over genetic biohacking is necessary to ensure that the possibility of misuse of biotechnology research that could harm public health is restricted by law as much as possible.

One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Recently, an international group of independent biohackers claim to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. ",

According Science Journal, \"private actors may not be inclined to regulate conduct that poses few risks to them, even if safety risks to others are numerous, obvious and serious.\" Although it is true that some biohacking groups have created their own ethics restrictions and safety policies that may help to avoid negative side-effects such as harm to public health, overall there are little to no ethical guidelines for the amateurs and individuals who practice biotechnology. However small the potential is for the development of material that could result in bioterrorism may be, the fact that there are no official rules and regulations to further restrict that is very dangerous. As such, greater regulatory and ethical control over genetic biohacking is necessary to ensure that the possibility of misuse of biotechnology research that could harm public health is further restricted as much as possible.

One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Recently, an international group of independent biohackers claim to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. ",

According Science Journal, \"private actors may not be inclined to regulate conduct that poses few risks to them, even if safety risks to others are numerous, obvious and serious.\" Although it is true that some biohacking groups have created their own ethics restrictions and safety policies that may help to avoid negative side-effects such as harm to public health, overall there are little to no ethical guidelines for the amateurs and individuals who practice biotechnology. However small the potential is for the development of material that could result in bioterrorism may be, the fact that there are no official rules and regulations to further restrict that is very dangerous. As such, greater regulatory and ethical control over genetic biohacking is necessary to ensure that the possibility of misuse of biotechnology research that could harm public health is further restricted as much as possible.

One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Recently, an international group of independent biohackers claim to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. ",

Even now, gene therapy products designed for self-administration are being sold to the public, despite the fact that the sale of these products is illegal as stated by FDA law. According Science Journal, \"private actors may not be inclined to regulate conduct that poses few risks to them, even if safety risks to others are numerous, obvious and serious.\" Although it is true that some biohacking groups have created their own ethics restrictions and safety policies that may help to avoid negative side-effects such as harm to public health, overall there are little to no ethical guidelines for the amateurs and individuals who practice biotechnology. However small the potential is for the development of material that could result in bioterrorism may be, the fact that there are no official rules and regulations to further restrict that is very dangerous. As such, greater regulatory and ethical control over genetic biohacking is necessary to ensure that the possibility of misuse of biotechnology research that could harm public health is further restricted as much as possible.

Through this independent research, Might succeeded in creating a community of families with children who possessed similar symptoms and thus helped scientists to discover how to more accurately diagnose this genetic disease.

One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Recently, an international group of independent biohackers claim to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. ",

Even now, gene therapy products designed for self-administration are being sold to the public, despite the fact that the sale of these products is illegal as stated by FDA law. According Science Journal, \"private actors may not be inclined to regulate conduct that poses few risks to them, even if safety risks to others are numerous, obvious and serious.\" Although it is true that some biohacking groups have created their own ethics restrictions and safety policies that may help to avoid negative side-effects such as harm to public health, overall there are little to no ethical guidelines for the amateurs and individuals who practice biotechnology. However small the potential is for the development of material that could result in bioterrorism may be, the fact that there are no official rules and regulations to further restrict that is very dangerous. As such, greater regulatory and ethical control over genetic biohacking is necessary to ensure that the possibility of misuse of biotechnology research that could harm public health is further restricted as much as possible.

One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Recently, an international group of independent biohackers claim to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. ",

According Science Journal, \"private actors may not be inclined to regulate conduct that poses few risks to them, even if safety risks to others are numerous, obvious and serious.\" Although it is true that some biohacking groups have created their own ethics restrictions and safety policies that may help to avoid negative side-effects such as harm to public health, overall there are little to no ethical guidelines for the amateurs and individuals who practice biotechnology. However small the potential is for the development of material that could result in bioterrorism may be, the fact that there are no official rules and regulations to further restrict that is very dangerous. As such, greater regulatory and ethical control over genetic biohacking is necessary to ensure that the possibility of misuse of biotechnology research that could harm public health is further restricted as much as possible.

In the example of Matt Might, a professor of computer engineering who worked with physicians for years to try and find some kind of diagnosis for his son who had a rare genetic disease. Through this independent research, Might succeeded in creating a community of families with children who possessed similar symptoms and thus helped scientists to discover how to more accurately diagnose this genetic disease. If greater regulatory control was imposed upon independent biohacking, scientific breakthroughs and discoveries such as this could be harder to achieve or even prevented. ",

One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Recently, an international group of independent biohackers claim to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. ",

One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Recently, an international group of independent biohackers claim to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. ",

According Science Journal, \"private actors may not be inclined to regulate conduct that poses few risks to them, even if safety risks to others are numerous, obvious and serious.\" Although it is true that some biohacking groups have created their own ethics restrictions and safety policies that may help to avoid negative side-effects such as harm to public health, overall there are little to no ethical guidelines for the amateurs and individuals who practice biotechnology. However small the potential is for the development of material that could result in bioterrorism may be, the fact that there are no official rules and regulations to further restrict that is very dangerous. As such, greater regulatory and ethical control over genetic biohacking is necessary to ensure that the possibility of misuse of biotechnology research that could harm public health is further restricted as much as possible.

One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Recently, an international group of independent biohackers claim to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. ",

According Science Journal, \"private actors may not be inclined to regulate conduct that poses few risks to them, even if safety risks to others are numerous, obvious and serious.\" Although it is true that some biohacking groups have created their own ethics restrictions and safety policies that may help to avoid negative side-effects such as harm to public health, overall there are little to no ethical guidelines for the amateurs and individuals who practice biotechnology. However small the potential is for the development of material that could result in bioterrorism may be, the fact that there are no official rules and regulations to further restrict that is very dangerous. As such, greater regulatory and ethical control over genetic biohacking is necessary to ensure that the possibility of misuse of biotechnology research that could harm public health is further restricted as much as possible.

One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Recently, an international group of independent biohackers claim to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. ",

Even now, gene therapy products designed for self-administration are being sold to the public, despite the fact that the sale of these products is illegal due to safety risks as stated by FDA law. According Science Journal, \"private actors may not be inclined to regulate conduct that poses few risks to them, even if safety risks to others are numerous, obvious and serious.\" Although it is true that some biohacking groups have created their own ethics restrictions and safety policies that may help to avoid negative side-effects such as harm to public health, overall there are little to no ethical guidelines for the amateurs and individuals who practice biotechnology. However small the potential is for the development of material that could result in bioterrorism may be, the fact that there are no official rules and regulations to further restrict that is very dangerous. As such, greater regulatory and ethical control over genetic biohacking is necessary to ensure that the possibility of misuse of biotechnology research that could harm public health is further restricted as much as possible.

Through this independent research, Might succeeded in creating a community of families with children who possessed similar symptoms and thus helped scientists to discover how to more accurately diagnose this genetic disease. If greater regulatory control was imposed upon independent biohacking, scientific breakthroughs and discoveries such as this could be harder to achieve or even prevented. ",

On the one hand, research by independent biotechnology communities could result in cheaper and faster life-saving drug therapy treatment for patients suffering with genetic diseases. With more regulations, the legitimacy and effectiveness of these treatments could be validated and therefore more widely distributed to save more people. Moreover, the implementation of international ethical guidelines for biohacking would reduce the chances of experimental genetic disasters and restrict any potential harm to public safety. On the other hand, genetic biohacking is such a vast and new topic that creating any official regulations or policies would be a long, complicated process. There is also the possibility that official governmental control over biohacking could prevent more life-saving discoveries. Overall, it can be argued that there is a need for some form of greater regulatory control  over genetic biohacking, yet creating and enforcing this control will be challenging. ",

One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Recently, an international group of independent biohackers claim to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. ",

Even now, gene therapy products designed for self-administration are being sold to the public, despite the fact that the sale of these products is illegal due to safety risks as stated by FDA law. According Science Journal, \"private actors may not be inclined to regulate conduct that poses few risks to them, even if safety risks to others are numerous, obvious and serious.\" Although it is true that some biohacking groups have created their own ethics restrictions and safety policies that may help to avoid negative side-effects such as harm to public health, overall there are little to no ethical guidelines for the amateurs and individuals who practice biotechnology. However small the potential is for the development of material that could result in bioterrorism may be, the fact that there are no official rules and regulations to further restrict that is very dangerous. As such, greater regulatory and ethical control over genetic biohacking is necessary to ensure that the possibility of misuse of biotechnology research that could harm public health is further restricted as much as possible.

One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Recently, an international group of independent biohackers claimed to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. ",

According Science Journal, \"private actors may not be inclined to regulate conduct that poses few risks to them, even if safety risks to others are numerous, obvious and serious.\" Although it is true that some biohacking groups have created their own ethics restrictions and safety policies that may help to avoid negative side-effects such as harm to public health, overall there are little to no ethical guidelines for the amateurs and individuals who practice biotechnology. However small the potential is for the development of material that could result in bioterrorism may be, the fact that there are no official rules and regulations to further restrict that is very dangerous. As such, greater regulatory and ethical control over genetic biohacking is necessary to ensure that the possibility of misuse of biotechnology research that could harm public health is further restricted as much as possible.

For example, Matt Might, a professor of computer engineering, worked with physicians for years to try and find some kind of diagnosis for his son who had a rare genetic disease. Thanks to this independent research, Might succeeded in creating a community of families with children who possessed similar symptoms and through this he helped scientists discover how to more accurately diagnose the genetic disease. If greater regulatory control was imposed upon independent biohacking, scientific breakthroughs and discoveries such as this could be harder to achieve or even prevented. ",

On the one hand, research by independent biotechnology communities could result in cheaper and faster life-saving drug therapy treatment for patients suffering with genetic diseases. With more regulations, the legitimacy and effectiveness of these treatments could be validated and therefore more widely distributed to save more people. Moreover, the implementation of international ethical guidelines for biohacking would reduce the chances of experimental genetic disasters and restrict any potential harm to public safety. On the other hand, genetic biohacking is such a vast and new topic that creating any official regulations or policies would be a long, complicated process. There is also the possibility that official governmental control over biohacking could prevent more life-saving discoveries. Overall, it can be argued that there is a need for some form of greater regulatory control over genetic biohacking, yet creating and enforcing any form of control will be challenging. ",

Thanks to this independent research, Might succeeded in creating a community of families with children who possessed similar symptoms and through this he helped scientists discover how to more accurately diagnose the genetic disease. If greater regulatory control was imposed upon independent biohacking, scientific breakthroughs and discoveries such as this could be harder to achieve or even prevented. ",

One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Recently, an international group of independent biohackers claimed to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. ",

One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Recently, an international group of independent biohackers claimed to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. ",

Even now, gene therapy products designed for self-administration are being sold to the public, despite the fact that the sale of these products is illegal due to safety risks as stated by FDA law. According Science Journal, \"private actors may not be inclined to regulate conduct that poses few risks to them, even if safety risks to others are numerous, obvious and serious.\" Although it is true that some biohacking groups have created their own ethics restrictions and safety policies that may help to avoid negative side-effects such as harm to public health, overall there are little to no ethical guidelines for the amateurs and individuals who practice biotechnology. However small the potential is for the development of material that could result in bioterrorism may be, the fact that there are no official rules and regulations to further restrict that is very dangerous. As such, greater regulatory and ethical control over genetic biohacking is necessary to ensure that the possibility of misuse of biotechnology research that could harm public health is further restricted as much as possible.

Thanks to this independent research, Might succeeded in creating a community of families with children who possessed similar symptoms and through this he helped scientists discover how to more accurately diagnose the genetic disease.

On the one hand, research by independent biotechnology communities could result in cheaper and faster life-saving drug therapy treatment for patients suffering with genetic diseases. With more regulations, the legitimacy and effectiveness of these treatments could be validated and therefore more widely distributed to save more people. Moreover, the implementation of international ethical guidelines for biohacking would reduce the chances of experimental genetic disasters and restrict any potential harm to public safety. On the other hand, genetic biohacking is such a vast and new topic that creating any official regulations or policies would be a long, complicated process. There is also the possibility that official governmental control over biohacking could prevent more life-saving discoveries. Overall, it can be argued that there is a need for some form of greater regulatory control over genetic biohacking, yet creating and enforcing any form of control will be challenging. ",

One example of this is the drug Glybera, the first gene therapy drug to be approved for treatment in 2015 and which costs $1 million per treatment. Recently, an international group of independent biohackers claimed to have created a prototype of a simpler, lower-cost version. However, as biohacking is such a new form of medicinal research and does not involve certified clinical trials, regulators question the scientific quality and effectiveness of experiments such as these. Consequently, these potentially life-saving treatments are not approved for public use or distribution. Therefore, if agencies such as as the US Food and Drug Administration took it upon themselves to assess the safety and validity of drugs and gene therapies created through biohacking, other regulation authorities would be able to approve these treatments for widespread use. This would benefit wider society and those who suffer from serious medical and genetic conditions. ",

However small the potential is for the development of material that could result in bioterrorism may be, the fact that there are no official rules and regulations to further restrict that is very dangerous.
