I am aiming to produce a coherent and succinct piece of writing which gets my point across. \",\"q2\":\"I think a good essay has to be clear. The structure of an essay is the most important because it is the most basic part. Even if an essay is well-researched and beautifully written, the argument must be easy to identify and followed. Of course, I think that the content of the essay itself is also crucial. It should be coherent to the reader and establishes a point of view on the topic. It should be focussed on the question which it tries to answer. \",\"q3\":\"The purposes of writing an essay as opposed to other methods of documentation would be to express more opinions. I think that essays tend to strongly word an argument in support or against a subject. It also allows for more elaboration in the specific arguments, which can be brought to criticism.\"}",

Genetic biohacking can be a source of hope for patients like Josiah Zayner. Should genetic biohacking be regulated then self-experimentation would cease. However,  Scientific American has pointed out that there is a lack of legitimacy in participatory health. The quality and validity of experiments outside clinical trials are often questioned. This means that even if Josiah Zayner does find a cure for his own genetic disease, this would not be viewed as a valid treatment. It stems from the fact that genetic biohacking is often perfromed by people who have little formal scientific training.  \n\nInterestingly, some biohacking communities have adopted their own ethics restrictions which could avoid harm to public health. This could be due to many of these biohackers also being members of community labs, meaning that their safety policies have the potential to promote safety in genetic biohacking. Even so, private sectors may not be inclined to regulate conduct that poses few risks to them. In other words, not all safety risks would be assessed. Unlike a governing body, such as the FDA, regulated the control of genetic biohacking then all safety risks will never be fully assessed.  \n\nDaniel Gerstein does worry that people will develop 'some sort of pathogen with robust capabilities' and 'the chance of misutilization'. Again, this stems from the fact that biohacking goes unregulated. Although in 2009, FBi agents did attend biohacking conferences and workshops to consider the threat of pathogens. The conclusion was that development of material that could be used in bioterrorism was highly unlikely. Nonetheless, the potential for there to be a catastrophic accident remains. It would not be unreasonable to mitigate this danger by placing greater regulatory control over genetic biohacking.\n\nGenetic biohacking can also provide a cheaper alternative for existing drugs such as Glybera, which is one of the most expensive drugs for genetic treatment. For patients who cannot afford Glybera, controlling biohacking would mean they would lose this benefit. On the other hand, there has been a report released by the UN Convention on Biological Diversity that discusses implications of synthetic biology on biodiversity and small-scale agriculture. It brings to question whether unregulated cheaper drugs should bring the environment to risk. \n\nThere are cases where the biohacking has helped researchers in diagnosing neurological disorders. Matt Might, whose son has a rare genetic disorder, created a community for children who possessed similar symptoms. This allowed researchers to gain a better understanding of the disorder. However, this is also what the FDA ought to do. The FDA plays a role in community engagment. From warning to educating people about the public health risks, the FDA should assists such communities. It has all the equipment and expertise needed to regulate biohacking. By involving the FDA and exerting greater control over genetic biohacking would help realise more of its potential to help people such as Matt Might and his son. It would be a safer, more open environment, in which genetic biohacking could be better understood and utilised in the realm of medicine.  \n\n",

But he’s also motivated in large part by frustration. Like some other\r\nbiohackers with an anti-establishment streak, he’s irritated by federal officials’ purported sluggishness in\r\ngreenlighting all sorts of medical treatments. In the US, it can take 10 years for a new drug to be developed\r\nand approved; for people with serious health conditions, that wait time can feel cruelly long. Zayner claims\r\nthat’s part of why he wants to democratize science and empower people to experiment on themselves.\r\nScientific American\r\nWhile intending to break new ground in underserved health domains, new forms of participatory health\r\nresearch suffer from a lack of legitimacy. Regulators tend to question the quality and scientific validity of\r\nexperiments that occur outside of certified clinical trials.\r\nMIT Technology Review\r\nCiting the tremendous cost of new drugs, an international group of biohackers say they are creating a\r\nknockoff of a million-dollar gene therapy. The drug being copied is Glybera, a gene therapy that was the\r\nworld’s most expensive drug when it came on the market in Europe in 2015 with a price tag of $1 million per\r\ntreatment. Glybera was the first gene therapy ever approved to treat an inherited disease. Now a band of\r\nindependent and amateur biologists say they have engineered a prototype of a simpler, low-cost version of\r\nGlybera.\r\nScience journal\r\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to formally wield its enforcement power over\r\nbiohacking, but the agency still has a role in community engagement—education, warning, and standardsetting for activities that pose public health risks. Through its longstanding role in assessing drugs and\r\nbiological products, FDA is the government regulatory agency equipped with the expertise to assess the\r\nsafety and effectiveness of genetic biohacking. FDA involvement, therefore, may help to realize the promise\r\nof genetic biohacking through guiding biohacking efforts toward interventions that live up to the\r\ncommunities’ hopes.\r\nScience journal\r\nJust as the popularization of computers in the late 1970s and early 1980s gave rise to computer hacking, the\r\nrecent accessibility and affordability of relatively easy (and widely hyped) genome-editing technologies and\r\nresources has spurred interest in genetic “biohacking”—molecular genetics experiments performed outside\r\ninstitutional laboratories by individuals who may have little formal scientific training.\r\nMIT Technology Review\r\n“Biotechnology, more than any other domain, has great potential for human good, but also has the\r\npossibility to be misused,” says Daniel Gerstein, a senior policy analyst at RAND and a former\r\nunder secretary at the US Department of Homeland Defense. “We are worried about people developing\r\nsome sort of pathogen with robust capabilities, but we are also concerned about the chance of \nmisutilization. We could have an accident occur with gene editing that is catastrophic, since the genome is\r\nthe very essence of life.”\r\nScientific American\r\nA professor of computer engineering, Matt Might, worked with many physicians for multiple years to find\r\neven a preliminary diagnosis for his son, who has a rare genetic disease. Matt hunted the genetic\r\nmechanisms responsible for Bertrand’s disease with the hope of finding targets for experimental therapies.\r\nHis subsequent work in building a community of families whose children possessed similar symptoms\r\nultimately aided researchers and physicians in the discovery of a more concrete diagnosis for the rare\r\nneurological disorder.\r\nUS Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\r\nFDA is aware that gene therapy products intended for self-administration and ‘do it yourself’ kits to produce\r\ngene therapies for self-administration are being made available to the public. The sale of these products is\r\nagainst the law. FDA is concerned about the safety risks involved.\r\nScience journal\r\nApart from legal mechanisms, some biohacking communities have adopted their own ethics restrictions,\r\nwhich, even if not intended to do so, might indirectly avoid harms to public health caused by genetic\r\nbiohacking. Given that many biohackers who conduct work at home are also members of community labs,\r\ntheir safety policies have the potential to go a long way in promoting safety in genetic biohacking.\r\nThe Brookings Institute\r\nBiohacking group DIYbio has provoked outrage among environmental groups. In March 2015, the UN\r\nConvention on Biological Diversity released a report discussing the implications of synthetic biology on\r\nbiodiversity and small-scale agriculture. Earlier this year, the FDA proposed regulations that would require\r\nany genetically-engineered organism to go through strict and lengthy regulatory trials to be approved.\r\nScience journal\r\nExperiments to modify genetic expression that once required specialized training and substantial\r\ninvestments in equipment and reagents can now be conducted for a few hundred dollars and with a basic\r\ninstruction manual. The rise of direct-to-consumer genetic testing has also resulted in individual access to\r\nraw genetic data, fueling a variety of health, wellness, ancestry, and relative identification services that offer\r\nto interpret those data.\r\nRoyal Society of Biology\r\nIn 2009, amid concerns that biohackers could create dangerous pathogens, the FBI began sending agents to\r\nbiohacking conferences and even sponsoring workshops in an attempt to better understand the burgeoning\r\namateur movement. Cooperation with law-enforcement agencies was welcomed by many biohackers, and it\r\nwas generally concluded that the development of material that could be used in bioterrorism was extremely\r\nunlikely.\r\nScience journal\r\nLike government regulation, private governance is important and laudable but not a perfect or\r\ncomprehensive solution. Private actors may not be inclined to regulate conduct that poses few risks to them,\r\neven if safety risks to others are numerous, obvious, and serious. In other cases, the social stigma of violating\r\ncommunity norms may simply be an ineffective deterrent.<!--EndFragment-->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>",

As Daniel Gerstein, a senior policy analyst at RAND and a former\r under secretary at the US Department of Homeland Defense points out, “Biotechnology, more than any other domain, has great potential for human good, but also has the\r possibility to be misused.\" Genetic biohacking is a double-edged sword which could benefit from being regulated by the government, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or from allowing biohackers to form their own ethical guidelines. The FDA are aware that gene therapy products intended for self-administration are being made available to the public and is worried about the safety risks involved, yet have not yet enforced any legalisation over biohacking. This essay will argue that greater regulatory control should be exerted over genetic biohacking, due to its potential to harm people. ",

Take, for example, Josiah Zayner, who has been experimenting on himself in attempts of cure himself of a genetic disease. These experiments were motivated mostly by his frustration at the sluggish greenlighting of medical treatments by the federal officials. It can take up 10 years for a new drug to be developed and approved in the US, which is a long time for a suffering patient to wait. Genetic biohacking can be a source of hope for patients like Josiah Zayner. It can also provide a cheaper alternative for existing drugs such as Glybera, which is one of the most expensive drugs for genetic treatment. ",

The FDA are aware that gene therapy products intended for self-administration are being made available to the public and is worried about the safety risks involved, yet have not yet enforced any legalisation over biohacking. This essay will argue that greater regulatory control should be exerted over genetic biohacking, due to its potential to harm people. ",

These experiments were motivated mostly by his frustration at the sluggish greenlighting of medical treatments by the federal officials. It can take up 10 years for a new drug to be developed and approved in the US, which is a long time for a suffering patient to wait. Genetic biohacking can be a source of hope for patients like Josiah Zayner. Should genetic biohacking be regulated then self-experimentation would cease. However,  Scientific American has pointed out that there is a lack of legitimacy in participatory health. The quality and validity of experiments outside clinical trials are often questioned. This means that even if Josiah Zayner does find a cure for his own genetic disease, this would not be viewed as a valid treatment. It stems from the fact that genetic biohacking is often perfromed by people who have little formal scientific training.  ",

The conclusion was that development of material that could be used in bioterrorism was highly unlikely. Nonetheless, the potential for there to be a catastrophic accident remains.

The FDA are aware that gene therapy products intended for self-administration are being made available to the public and is worried about the safety risks involved, yet have not yet enforced any legalisation over biohacking.

These experiments were motivated mostly by his frustration at the sluggish greenlighting of medical treatments by the federal officials. It can take up 10 years for a new drug to be developed and approved in the US, which is a long time for a suffering patient to wait. Genetic biohacking can be a source of hope for patients like Josiah Zayner. Should genetic biohacking be regulated then self-experimentation would cease. However,  Scientific American has pointed out that there is a lack of legitimacy in participatory health. The quality and validity of experiments outside clinical trials are often questioned. This means that even if Josiah Zayner does find a cure for his own genetic disease, this would not be viewed as a valid treatment. It stems from the fact that genetic biohacking is often perfromed by people who have little formal scientific training.  ",
