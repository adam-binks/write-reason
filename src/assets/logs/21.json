  "preTaskSubmission": "{\"q1\":\"I try and produce work that makes a genuine contribution to knowledge. By this I mean, through my writing I try to make a point not made before, or introduce a research methodology that may not have been used much.\",\"q2\":\"A good essay consists of a clear structure, an novel argument and relevant references to existing scholarship. The first and the last one's are particularly tricky. It is key that you guide your reader step by step with your writing. It is also important that you do not overuse existing scholarship and only make references to the extent to which it is useful for your own essay. The novel argument is often the easiest part. This is especially if you manage to take care of the other two parts.\",\"q3\":\"Making a contribution to knowledge, getting a good grade, honing your writing skills, exploring a new idea, indicating the level of your research you have done. The essay in the broader sense of the term i.e. including non-academic use, is about showing a deep personal engagement with a topic. That i believe is the ultimate purpose of the essay.\"}",

Further it seeks to foster 'civility and interaction' between different modes of transport (vehicles, bikes, cars etc.) and encourage communication through 'social cues rather than assigning right-of-way to one mode over another'. This definition suggests that the idea of Shared Space want to put traffic control within the ambit of the people who make the traffic rather than depend on an external imposition, such as that which comes from law or administrative bodies that structure the use of space currently. Under this reasoning, the latter form of traffic regulation would be seen as an imposition coming from external sources and discourages such imposition in favour of people coming to their equations over how traffic is best regulated in a space.\n\nOn the surface of it, the idea seems noble. It places trust in people's judgements, as if democratising the process of traffic regulation. There may even appear to be a practicality to it, as it seems to recognise the inherent fluidity of spaces and their varied use at different points, by suggesting people will figure out how best to move across the space. The PPS also suggests that Shared spaces also hark back to a 19th Century practice where streets were a 'coherent scheme' as opposed to the subsequent promotion of motor vehicles and their freedom of movement, that led to severe restrictions on the ability of a pedestrian to move across the streets.\n\nThe UK Department for Transport seems to have been building on  PPS's ideas here when it stated defines shared space as 'a design approach that seeks to change the way streets operate by reducing the dominance of motor vehicles, primarily through lower speeds and encouraging drivers to behave more accommodatingly towards pedestrians.'\n\nHowever,  if the intentions were sufficient in themselves, the empirical examples of how Shared Spaces have faired would be more positive. The Holmes report on Shared Spaces, showed that a majority of 63% found their experience with Shared space poor. They also reported that in the absence of kerbing, a function of Shared Space, people complained about the lack of having a safe space.

Analysing this definition, I will move on to my arguments about how the definition fails to take into account the power dynamics that also comprises of urban designs. Therefore, despite the best intentions behind it, it fails to achieve the aim of Shared Spaces.\n\nShared Spaces is defined by pps as a design that creates a 'typically a low-speed environment that desegregates road users and removes traffic controls such as traffic lights, excessive signage and road markings. This “humanization” of the road then frees up space for non-traffic functions.' . Further it seeks to foster 'civility and interaction' between different modes of transport (vehicles, bikes, cars etc.) and encourage communication through 'social cues rather than assigning right-of-way to one mode over another'. This definition suggests that the idea of Shared Space want to put traffic control within the ambit of the people who make the traffic rather than depend on an external imposition, such as that which comes from law or administrative bodies that structure the use of space currently. Under this reasoning, the latter form of traffic regulation would be seen as an imposition coming from external sources and discourages such imposition in favour of people coming to their equations over how traffic is best regulated in a space.\n\nOn the surface of it, the idea seems noble. It places trust in people's judgements, as if democratising the process of traffic regulation. There may even appear to be a practicality to it, as it seems to recognise the inherent fluidity of spaces and their varied use at different points, by suggesting people will figure out how best to move across the space. The PPS also suggests that Shared spaces also hark back to a 19th Century practice where streets were a 'coherent scheme' as opposed to the subsequent promotion of motor vehicles and their freedom of movement, that led to severe restrictions on the ability of a pedestrian to move across the streets.\n\nThe UK Department for Transport seems to have been building on  PPS's ideas here when it stated defines shared space as 'a design approach that seeks to change the way streets operate by reducing the dominance of motor vehicles, primarily through lower speeds and encouraging drivers to behave more accommodatingly towards pedestrians.'\n\nHowever,  if the intentions were sufficient in themselves, the empirical examples of how Shared Spaces have faired would be more positive. The Holmes report on Shared Spaces, showed that a majority of 63% found their experience with Shared space poor. They also reported that in the absence of kerbing, a function of Shared Space, people complained about the lack of having a safe space.

Therefore, rather than encouraging communication between pedestrian and vehicle and slowing down the latter, the Shared Space in practice has noted an increase in such date.

Further it seeks to foster 'civility and interaction' between different modes of transport (vehicles, bikes, cars etc.) and encourage communication through 'social cues rather than assigning right-of-way to one mode over another'. This definition suggests that the idea of Shared Space want to put traffic control within the ambit of the people who make the traffic rather than depend on an external imposition, such as that which comes from law or administrative bodies that structure the use of space currently.

It places trust in people's judgements, as if democratising the process of traffic regulation. There may even appear to be a practicality to it, as it seems to recognise the inherent fluidity of spaces and their varied use at different points, by suggesting people will figure out how best to move across the space. The PPS also suggests that Shared spaces also hark back to a 19th Century practice where streets were a 'coherent scheme' as opposed to the subsequent promotion of motor vehicles and their freedom of movement, that led to severe restrictions on the ability of a pedestrian to move across the streets.\n\nThe UK Department for Transport seems to have been building on  PPS's ideas here when it stated defines shared space as 'a design approach that seeks to change the way streets operate by reducing the dominance of motor vehicles, primarily through lower speeds and encouraging drivers to behave more accommodatingly towards pedestrians.'\n\nHowever,  if the intentions were sufficient in themselves, the empirical examples of how Shared Spaces have faired would be more positive.

They also reported that in the absence of kerbing, a function of Shared Space, people complained about the lack of having a safe space.

Analysing this definition, I will move on to my arguments about how the definition fails to take into account the power dynamics that also comprises of urban designs. Therefore, despite the best intentions behind it, it fails to achieve the aim of Shared Spaces.\n\nShared Spaces is defined by pps as a design that creates a 'typically a low-speed environment that desegregates road users and removes traffic controls such as traffic lights, excessive signage and road markings. This “humanization” of the road then frees up space for non-traffic functions.' . Further it seeks to foster 'civility and interaction' between different modes of transport (vehicles, bikes, cars etc.) and encourage communication through 'social cues rather than assigning right-of-way to one mode over another'. This definition suggests that the idea of Shared Space want to put traffic control within the ambit of the people who make the traffic rather than depend on an external imposition, such as that which comes from law or administrative bodies that structure the use of space currently. Under this reasoning, the latter form of traffic regulation would be seen as an imposition coming from external sources and discourages such imposition in favour of people coming to their equations over how traffic is best regulated in a space.\n\nOn the surface of it, the idea seems noble. It places trust in people's judgements, as if democratising the process of traffic regulation. There may even appear to be a practicality to it, as it seems to recognise the inherent fluidity of spaces and their varied use at different points, by suggesting people will figure out how best to move across the space. The PPS also suggests that Shared spaces also hark back to a 19th Century practice where streets were a 'coherent scheme' as opposed to the subsequent promotion of motor vehicles and their freedom of movement, that led to severe restrictions on the ability of a pedestrian to move across the streets.\n\nThe UK Department for Transport seems to have been building on  PPS's ideas here when it stated defines shared space as 'a design approach that seeks to change the way streets operate by reducing the dominance of motor vehicles, primarily through lower speeds and encouraging drivers to behave more accommodatingly towards pedestrians.'\n\nHowever,  if the intentions were sufficient in themselves, the empirical examples of how Shared Spaces have faired would be more positive. The Holmes report on Shared Spaces, showed that a majority of 63% found their experience with Shared space poor. They also reported that in the absence of kerbing, a function of Shared Space, people complained about the lack of having a safe space.

Therefore, rather than encouraging communication between pedestrian and vehicle and slowing down the latter, the Shared Space in practice has noted an increase in such date.

Further it seeks to foster 'civility and interaction' between different modes of transport (vehicles, bikes, cars etc.) and encourage communication through 'social cues rather than assigning right-of-way to one mode over another'. This definition suggests that the idea of Shared Space want to put traffic control within the ambit of the people who make the traffic rather than depend on an external imposition, such as that which comes from law or administrative bodies that structure the use of space currently. Under this reasoning, the latter form of traffic regulation would be seen as an imposition coming from external sources and discourages such imposition in favour of people coming to their equations over how traffic is best regulated in a space.\n\nOn the surface of it, the idea seems noble. It places trust in people's judgements, as if democratising the process of traffic regulation. There may even appear to be a practicality to it, as it seems to recognise the inherent fluidity of spaces and their varied use at different points, by suggesting people will figure out how best to move across the space. The PPS also suggests that Shared spaces also hark back to a 19th Century practice where streets were a 'coherent scheme' as opposed to the subsequent promotion of motor vehicles and their freedom of movement, that led to severe restrictions on the ability of a pedestrian to move across the streets.\n\nThe UK Department for Transport seems to have been building on  PPS's ideas here when it stated defines shared space as 'a design approach that seeks to change the way streets operate by reducing the dominance of motor vehicles, primarily through lower speeds and encouraging drivers to behave more accommodatingly towards pedestrians.'\n\nHowever,  if the intentions were sufficient in themselves, the empirical examples of how Shared Spaces have faired would be more positive. The Holmes report on Shared Spaces, showed that a majority of 63% found their experience with Shared space poor. They also reported that in the absence of kerbing, a function of Shared Space, people complained about the lack of having a safe space.

Analysing this definition, I will move on to my arguments about how the definition fails to take into account the power dynamics that also comprises of urban designs. Therefore, despite the best intentions behind it, it fails to achieve the aim of Shared Spaces.\n\nShared Spaces is defined by pps as a design that creates a 'typically a low-speed environment that desegregates road users and removes traffic controls such as traffic lights, excessive signage and road markings. This “humanization” of the road then frees up space for non-traffic functions.' . Further it seeks to foster 'civility and interaction' between different modes of transport (vehicles, bikes, cars etc.) and encourage communication through 'social cues rather than assigning right-of-way to one mode over another'. This definition suggests that the idea of Shared Space want to put traffic control within the ambit of the people who make the traffic rather than depend on an external imposition, such as that which comes from law or administrative bodies that structure the use of space currently. Under this reasoning, the latter form of traffic regulation would be seen as an imposition coming from external sources and discourages such imposition in favour of people coming to their equations over how traffic is best regulated in a space.\n\nOn the surface of it, the idea seems noble. It places trust in people's judgements, as if democratising the process of traffic regulation. There may even appear to be a practicality to it, as it seems to recognise the inherent fluidity of spaces and their varied use at different points, by suggesting people will figure out how best to move across the space. The PPS also suggests that Shared spaces also hark back to a 19th Century practice where streets were a 'coherent scheme' as opposed to the subsequent promotion of motor vehicles and their freedom of movement, that led to severe restrictions on the ability of a pedestrian to move across the streets.\n\nThe UK Department for Transport seems to have been building on  PPS's ideas here when it stated defines shared space as 'a design approach that seeks to change the way streets operate by reducing the dominance of motor vehicles, primarily through lower speeds and encouraging drivers to behave more accommodatingly towards pedestrians.'\n\nHowever,  if the intentions were sufficient in themselves, the empirical examples of how Shared Spaces have faired would be more positive. The Holmes report on Shared Spaces, showed that a majority of 63% found their experience with Shared space poor. They also reported that in the absence of kerbing, a function of Shared Space, people complained about the lack of having a safe space.

Therefore, rather than encouraging communication between pedestrian and vehicle and slowing down the latter, the Shared Space in practice has noted an increase in such date.

Further it seeks to foster 'civility and interaction' between different modes of transport (vehicles, bikes, cars etc.) and encourage communication through 'social cues rather than assigning right-of-way to one mode over another'. This definition suggests that the idea of Shared Space want to put traffic control within the ambit of the people who make the traffic rather than depend on an external imposition, such as that which comes from law or administrative bodies that structure the use of space currently. Under this reasoning, the latter form of traffic regulation would be seen as an imposition coming from external sources and discourages such imposition in favour of people coming to their equations over how traffic is best regulated in a space.\n\nOn the surface of it, the idea seems noble. It places trust in people's judgements, as if democratising the process of traffic regulation. There may even appear to be a practicality to it, as it seems to recognise the inherent fluidity of spaces and their varied use at different points, by suggesting people will figure out how best to move across the space. The PPS also suggests that Shared spaces also hark back to a 19th Century practice where streets were a 'coherent scheme' as opposed to the subsequent promotion of motor vehicles and their freedom of movement, that led to severe restrictions on the ability of a pedestrian to move across the streets.\n\nThe UK Department for Transport seems to have been building on  PPS's ideas here when it stated defines shared space as 'a design approach that seeks to change the way streets operate by reducing the dominance of motor vehicles, primarily through lower speeds and encouraging drivers to behave more accommodatingly towards pedestrians.'\n\nHowever,  if the intentions were sufficient in themselves, the empirical examples of how Shared Spaces have faired would be more positive. The Holmes report on Shared Spaces, showed that a majority of 63% found their experience with Shared space poor. They also reported that in the absence of kerbing, a function of Shared Space, people complained about the lack of having a safe space.

Analysing this definition, I will move on to my arguments about how the definition fails to take into account the power dynamics that also comprises of urban designs. Therefore, despite the best intentions behind it, it fails to achieve the aim of Shared Spaces.\n\nShared Spaces is defined by pps as a design that creates a 'typically a low-speed environment that desegregates road users and removes traffic controls such as traffic lights, excessive signage and road markings. This “humanization” of the road then frees up space for non-traffic functions.' . Further it seeks to foster 'civility and interaction' between different modes of transport (vehicles, bikes, cars etc.) and encourage communication through 'social cues rather than assigning right-of-way to one mode over another'. This definition suggests that the idea of Shared Space want to put traffic control within the ambit of the people who make the traffic rather than depend on an external imposition, such as that which comes from law or administrative bodies that structure the use of space currently. Under this reasoning, the latter form of traffic regulation would be seen as an imposition coming from external sources and discourages such imposition in favour of people coming to their equations over how traffic is best regulated in a space.\n\nOn the surface of it, the idea seems noble. It places trust in people's judgements, as if democratising the process of traffic regulation. There may even appear to be a practicality to it, as it seems to recognise the inherent fluidity of spaces and their varied use at different points, by suggesting people will figure out how best to move across the space. The PPS also suggests that Shared spaces also hark back to a 19th Century practice where streets were a 'coherent scheme' as opposed to the subsequent promotion of motor vehicles and their freedom of movement, that led to severe restrictions on the ability of a pedestrian to move across the streets.\n\nThe UK Department for Transport seems to have been building on  PPS's ideas here when it stated defines shared space as 'a design approach that seeks to change the way streets operate by reducing the dominance of motor vehicles, primarily through lower speeds and encouraging drivers to behave more accommodatingly towards pedestrians.'\n\nHowever,  if the intentions were sufficient in themselves, the empirical examples of how Shared Spaces have faired would be more positive. The Holmes report on Shared Spaces, showed that a majority of 63% found their experience with Shared space poor. They also reported that in the absence of kerbing, a function of Shared Space, people complained about the lack of having a safe space.

Therefore, rather than encouraging communication between pedestrian and vehicle and slowing down the latter, the Shared Space in practice has noted an increase in such date.

Further it seeks to foster 'civility and interaction' between different modes of transport (vehicles, bikes, cars etc.) and encourage communication through 'social cues rather than assigning right-of-way to one mode over another'. This definition suggests that the idea of Shared Space want to put traffic control within the ambit of the people who make the traffic rather than depend on an external imposition, such as that which comes from law or administrative bodies that structure the use of space currently. Under this reasoning, the latter form of traffic regulation would be seen as an imposition coming from external sources and discourages such imposition in favour of people coming to their equations over how traffic is best regulated in a space.\n\nOn the surface of it, the idea seems noble. It places trust in people's judgements, as if democratising the process of traffic regulation. There may even appear to be a practicality to it, as it seems to recognise the inherent fluidity of spaces and their varied use at different points, by suggesting people will figure out how best to move across the space. The PPS also suggests that Shared spaces also hark back to a 19th Century practice where streets were a 'coherent scheme' as opposed to the subsequent promotion of motor vehicles and their freedom of movement, that led to severe restrictions on the ability of a pedestrian to move across the streets.\n\nThe UK Department for Transport seems to have been building on  PPS's ideas here when it stated defines shared space as 'a design approach that seeks to change the way streets operate by reducing the dominance of motor vehicles, primarily through lower speeds and encouraging drivers to behave more accommodatingly towards pedestrians.'\n\nHowever,  if the intentions were sufficient in themselves, the empirical examples of how Shared Spaces have faired would be more positive. The Holmes report on Shared Spaces, showed that a majority of 63% found their experience with Shared space poor. They also reported that in the absence of kerbing, a function of Shared Space, people complained about the lack of having a safe space.

Analysing this definition, I will move on to my arguments about how the definition fails to take into account the power dynamics that also comprises of urban designs. Therefore, despite the best intentions behind it, it fails to achieve the aim of Shared Spaces.\n\nShared Spaces is defined by pps as a design that creates a 'typically a low-speed environment that desegregates road users and removes traffic controls such as traffic lights, excessive signage and road markings. This “humanization” of the road then frees up space for non-traffic functions.' . Further it seeks to foster 'civility and interaction' between different modes of transport (vehicles, bikes, cars etc.) and encourage communication through 'social cues rather than assigning right-of-way to one mode over another'. This definition suggests that the idea of Shared Space want to put traffic control within the ambit of the people who make the traffic rather than depend on an external imposition, such as that which comes from law or administrative bodies that structure the use of space currently. Under this reasoning, the latter form of traffic regulation would be seen as an imposition coming from external sources and discourages such imposition in favour of people coming to their equations over how traffic is best regulated in a space.\n\nOn the surface of it, the idea seems noble. It places trust in people's judgements, as if democratising the process of traffic regulation. There may even appear to be a practicality to it, as it seems to recognise the inherent fluidity of spaces and their varied use at different points, by suggesting people will figure out how best to move across the space. The PPS also suggests that Shared spaces also hark back to a 19th Century practice where streets were a 'coherent scheme' as opposed to the subsequent promotion of motor vehicles and their freedom of movement, that led to severe restrictions on the ability of a pedestrian to move across the streets.\n\nThe UK Department for Transport seems to have been building on  PPS's ideas here when it stated defines shared space as 'a design approach that seeks to change the way streets operate by reducing the dominance of motor vehicles, primarily through lower speeds and encouraging drivers to behave more accommodatingly towards pedestrians.'\n\nHowever,  if the intentions were sufficient in themselves, the empirical examples of how Shared Spaces have faired would be more positive. The Holmes report on Shared Spaces, showed that a majority of 63% found their experience with Shared space poor. They also reported that in the absence of kerbing, a function of Shared Space, people complained about the lack of having a safe space.

Further it seeks to foster 'civility and interaction' between different modes of transport (vehicles, bikes, cars etc.) and encourage communication through 'social cues rather than assigning right-of-way to one mode over another'. This definition suggests that the idea of Shared Space want to put traffic control within the ambit of the people who make the traffic rather than depend on an external imposition, such as that which comes from law or administrative bodies that structure the use of space currently. Under this reasoning, the latter form of traffic regulation would be seen as an imposition coming from external sources and discourages such imposition in favour of people coming to their equations over how traffic is best regulated in a space.\n\nOn the surface of it, the idea seems noble. It places trust in people's judgements, as if democratising the process of traffic regulation. There may even appear to be a practicality to it, as it seems to recognise the inherent fluidity of spaces and their varied use at different points, by suggesting people will figure out how best to move across the space. The PPS also suggests that Shared spaces also hark back to a 19th Century practice where streets were a 'coherent scheme' as opposed to the subsequent promotion of motor vehicles and their freedom of movement, that led to severe restrictions on the ability of a pedestrian to move across the streets.\n\nThe UK Department for Transport seems to have been building on  PPS's ideas here when it stated defines shared space as 'a design approach that seeks to change the way streets operate by reducing the dominance of motor vehicles, primarily through lower speeds and encouraging drivers to behave more accommodatingly towards pedestrians.'\n\nHowever,  if the intentions were sufficient in themselves, the empirical examples of how Shared Spaces have faired would be more positive. The Holmes report on Shared Spaces, showed that a majority of 63% found their experience with Shared space poor. They also reported that in the absence of kerbing, a function of Shared Space, people complained about the lack of having a safe space.

Analysing this definition, I will move on to my arguments about how the definition fails to take into account the power dynamics that also comprises of urban designs. Therefore, despite the best intentions behind it, it fails to achieve the aim of Shared Spaces.\n\nShared Spaces is defined by pps as a design that creates a 'typically a low-speed environment that desegregates road users and removes traffic controls such as traffic lights, excessive signage and road markings. This “humanization” of the road then frees up space for non-traffic functions.' . Further it seeks to foster 'civility and interaction' between different modes of transport (vehicles, bikes, cars etc.) and encourage communication through 'social cues rather than assigning right-of-way to one mode over another'. This definition suggests that the idea of Shared Space want to put traffic control within the ambit of the people who make the traffic rather than depend on an external imposition, such as that which comes from law or administrative bodies that structure the use of space currently. Under this reasoning, the latter form of traffic regulation would be seen as an imposition coming from external sources and discourages such imposition in favour of people coming to their equations over how traffic is best regulated in a space.\n\nOn the surface of it, the idea seems noble. It places trust in people's judgements, as if democratising the process of traffic regulation. There may even appear to be a practicality to it, as it seems to recognise the inherent fluidity of spaces and their varied use at different points, by suggesting people will figure out how best to move across the space. The PPS also suggests that Shared spaces also hark back to a 19th Century practice where streets were a 'coherent scheme' as opposed to the subsequent promotion of motor vehicles and their freedom of movement, that led to severe restrictions on the ability of a pedestrian to move across the streets.\n\nThe UK Department for Transport seems to have been building on  PPS's ideas here when it stated defines shared space as 'a design approach that seeks to change the way streets operate by reducing the dominance of motor vehicles, primarily through lower speeds and encouraging drivers to behave more accommodatingly towards pedestrians.'\n\nHowever,  if the intentions were sufficient in themselves, the empirical examples of how Shared Spaces have faired would be more positive. The Holmes report on Shared Spaces, showed that a majority of 63% found their experience with Shared space poor. They also reported that in the absence of kerbing, a function of Shared Space, people complained about the lack of having a safe space.

Therefore, rather than encouraging communication between pedestrian and vehicle and slowing down the latter, the Shared Space in practice has noted an increase in such date.

Further it seeks to foster 'civility and interaction' between different modes of transport (vehicles, bikes, cars etc.) and encourage communication through 'social cues rather than assigning right-of-way to one mode over another'. This definition suggests that the idea of Shared Space want to put traffic control within the ambit of the people who make the traffic rather than depend on an external imposition, such as that which comes from law or administrative bodies that structure the use of space currently. Under this reasoning, the latter form of traffic regulation would be seen as an imposition coming from external sources and discourages such imposition in favour of people coming to their equations over how traffic is best regulated in a space.\n\nOn the surface of it, the idea seems noble. It places trust in people's judgements, as if democratising the process of traffic regulation. There may even appear to be a practicality to it, as it seems to recognise the inherent fluidity of spaces and their varied use at different points, by suggesting people will figure out how best to move across the space. The PPS also suggests that Shared spaces also hark back to a 19th Century practice where streets were a 'coherent scheme' as opposed to the subsequent promotion of motor vehicles and their freedom of movement, that led to severe restrictions on the ability of a pedestrian to move across the streets.\n\nThe UK Department for Transport seems to have been building on  PPS's ideas here when it stated defines shared space as 'a design approach that seeks to change the way streets operate by reducing the dominance of motor vehicles, primarily through lower speeds and encouraging drivers to behave more accommodatingly towards pedestrians.'\n\nHowever,  if the intentions were sufficient in themselves, the empirical examples of how Shared Spaces have faired would be more positive. The Holmes report on Shared Spaces, showed that a majority of 63% found their experience with Shared space poor. They also reported that in the absence of kerbing, a function of Shared Space, people complained about the lack of having a safe space.

I take as my starting point the Project for Public Spaces' (pps) definition of shared spaces. Analysing this definition, I will move on to my arguments about how the definition fails to take into account the power dynamics that also comprises of urban designs. Therefore, despite the best intentions behind it, it fails to achieve the aim of Shared Spaces.\n\nShared Spaces is defined by pps as a design that creates a 'typically a low-speed environment that desegregates road users and removes traffic controls such as traffic lights, excessive signage and road markings. This “humanization” of the road then frees up space for non-traffic functions.' . Further it seeks to foster 'civility and interaction' between different modes of transport (vehicles, bikes, cars etc.) and encourage communication through 'social cues rather than assigning right-of-way to one mode over another'. This definition suggests that the idea of Shared Space want to put traffic control within the ambit of the people who make the traffic rather than depend on an external imposition, such as that which comes from law or administrative bodies that structure the use of space currently. Under this reasoning, the latter form of traffic regulation would be seen as an imposition coming from external sources and discourages such imposition in favour of people coming to their equations over how traffic is best regulated in a space.\n\nOn the surface of it, the idea seems noble. It places trust in people's judgements, as if democratising the process of traffic regulation. There may even appear to be a practicality to it, as it seems to recognise the inherent fluidity of spaces and their varied use at different points, by suggesting people will figure out how best to move across the space.

I take as my starting point the Project for Public Spaces' (PPS) definition of shared spaces. Analysing this definition, I will move on to my arguments about how the definition fails to take into account the power dynamics that urban designs are based on. Therefore, despite the best intentions behind it, it fails to achieve the aim of Shared Spaces.\n\nShared Spaces is defined by PPS as a design that creates a 'typically a low-speed environment that desegregates road users and removes traffic controls such as traffic lights, excessive signage and road markings. This “humanization” of the road then frees up space for non-traffic functions.' . Further it seeks to foster 'civility and interaction' between different modes of transport (vehicles, bikes, cars etc.) and encourage communication through 'social cues rather than assigning right-of-way to one mode over another'. This definition suggests that the idea of Shared Space want to put traffic control within the ambit of the people who make the traffic rather than depend on an external imposition, such as that which comes from law or administrative bodies that structure the use of space currently. Under this reasoning, the latter form of traffic regulation would be seen as an imposition coming from external sources and discourages such imposition in favour of people coming to their equations over how traffic is best regulated in a space.\n\nOn the surface of it, the idea seems noble. It places trust in people's judgements, as if democratising the process of traffic regulation. There may even appear to be a practicality to it, as it seems to recognise the inherent fluidity of spaces and their varied use at different points, by suggesting people will figure out how best to move across the space. The PPS also suggests that Shared spaces also hark back to a 19th Century practice where streets were a 'coherent scheme' as opposed to the subsequent promotion of motor vehicles and their freedom of movement, that led to severe restrictions on the ability of a pedestrian to move across the streets.\n\nThe UK Department for Transport seems to have been building on  PPS's ideas here when it stated defines shared space as 'a design approach that seeks to change the way streets operate by reducing the dominance of motor vehicles, primarily through lower speeds and encouraging drivers to behave more accommodatingly towards pedestrians.'\n\nHowever,  if the intentions were sufficient in themselves, the empirical examples of how Shared Spaces have faired would be more positive. The Holmes report on Shared Spaces, showed that a majority of 63% found their experience with Shared space poor. They also reported that in the absence of kerbing, a function of Shared Space, people complained about the lack of having a safe space. Expressing a similar sentiment a pedestrian with Cerebral Palsy stated that Shared Space takes away the comfort of spaces such as Zebra crossings and made them feel much more unsafe (The Women and Equalities Committee Report). \n\nJustifying such fear the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea pedestrian behaviour study of 2013 noted in the exhibition road Shared Space in South Kensington, the car speeds went up by 5 miles in the shared space area. Therefore, rather than encouraging communication between pedestrian and vehicle and slowing down the latter, the Shared Space in practice has noted an increase in such date. A study done in the University of West Virginia's downtown campus also supports this observation. The conversion of a buys pedestrian crossing to a Shared Space saw the vehicle travel times cut down by more than 50%. This indicates faster rather than slower cars. \n\nWhile Poyton and Bexleyheath High Street have been mentioned as spaces where the Shared Space Scheme has been successful, the Urban Design Group that makes this claim has mentioned little else to explain what they mean by success. If the intention is to create a more communicative understanding between users of streets and crossings, then it would follow that success for a Shared Space be that each party is understood. The evidence from Poyton and Bexleyheath is insufficient here. \n\nTherefore, I would argue that Shared Space should be a part of urban planning as the empirical evidence seems to suggest that they do not achieve their desired goal.\n\nHowever, there may be one further argument to be made here in favour of Shared Spaces. The Dutch Institute for Road Safety Research proposed that Shared Space be used in residential areas where 'traffic is guest', and when creating such a space the residential nature of the area be made clear.\n\nHowever, I think opinion the issue with how Shared Space is envisaged, seems to be that among spaces planned by external regulation, which by PPS's own admission has been favouring vehicles across the 20th century,  small pockets of such spaces are to be created. The issue that arises that the pedestrian and the vehicle driver are anyway part of an unfair equation, which plays itself out even more unequally when the limited protections that external regulations offer are taken away. This would be supported by the fact that vehicles seem to take the lack of regulation as an encouragement to go faster, as shown by the evidence above. \n\nTherefore, the fundamental issue with Shared Space as part of urban planning is that the their inclusion does little to alter the larger principle of favouring vehicles that is part of urban designs.

I take as my starting point the Project for Public Spaces' (PPS) definition of shared spaces. Analysing this definition, I will move on to my arguments about how the definition fails to take into account the power dynamics that urban designs are based on. Therefore, despite the best intentions behind Shared Spaces, they fail to achieve the aim they were encouraged for.\n\nShared Space is defined by PPS as a design that creates a 'typically a low-speed environment that desegregates road users and removes traffic controls such as traffic lights, excessive signage and road markings. This “humanization” of the road then frees up space for non-traffic functions.' . Further it seeks to foster 'civility and interaction' between different modes of transport (vehicles, bikes, cars etc.) and encourage communication through 'social cues rather than assigning right-of-way to one mode over another'. This definition suggests that the idea of Shared Space want to put traffic control within the ambit of the people who make the traffic rather than depend on an external bodies, such as those that come from law or administrative bodies that structure the use of space currently. Under this reasoning, the latter form of traffic regulation would be seen as an imposition coming from external sources and discourages such imposition in favour of people coming to their decisions over how traffic is best regulated in a space.\n\nOn the surface of it, the idea seems noble. It places trust in people's judgements, as if democratising the process of traffic regulation. There may even appear to be a practicality to it, as it seems to recognise the inherent fluidity of spaces and their varied use at different points, by suggesting people will figure out how best to move across the space. The PPS also suggests that Shared spaces also hark back to a 19th Century practice where streets were a 'coherent scheme' as opposed to the subsequent promotion of motor vehicles and their freedom of movement, that led to severe restrictions on the ability of a pedestrian to move across the streets.\n\nThe UK Department for Transport also seems to have been building on  PPS's ideas, when it stated that Shared Space is 'a design approach that seeks to change the way streets operate by reducing the dominance of motor vehicles, primarily through lower speeds and encouraging drivers to behave more accommodatingly towards pedestrians.'\n\nHowever,  if the intentions were sufficient in themselves, the empirical examples of how Shared Spaces have faired would be more positive. The Holmes report on Shared Spaces, showed that a majority of 63% found their experience with Shared space poor. They also reported that in the absence of kerbing, a function of Shared Space, people complained about the lack of having a safe space. Expressing a similar sentiment a pedestrian with Cerebral Palsy stated that Shared Space takes away the comfort of pedestrian friendly spaces such as Zebra crossings, and made them feel much more unsafe (The Women and Equalities Committee Report). \n\nJustifying such fear the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea pedestrian behaviour study of 2013 noted in the exhibition road Shared Space in South Kensington, the car speeds went up by 5 miles in the shared space area, that the Paralympic Swimming Gold Medalist Lord Holmes called 'fatal'.

Further it seeks to foster 'civility and interaction' between different modes of transport (vehicles, bikes, cars etc.) and encourage communication through 'social cues rather than assigning right-of-way to one mode over another'. This definition suggests that the idea of Shared Space want to put traffic control within the ambit of the people who make the traffic rather than depend on an external imposition, such as that which comes from law or administrative bodies that structure the use of space currently. Under this reasoning, the latter form of traffic regulation would be seen as an imposition coming from external sources and discourages such imposition in favour of people coming to their equations over how traffic is best regulated in a space.",

This “humanization” of the road then frees up space for non-traffic functions.' . Further it seeks to foster 'civility and interaction' between different modes of transport (vehicles, bikes, cars etc.) and encourage communication through 'social cues rather than assigning right-of-way to one mode over another'. This definition suggests that the idea of Shared Space want to put traffic control within the ambit of the people who make the traffic rather than depend on an external imposition, such as that which comes from law or administrative bodies that structure the use of space currently. Under this reasoning, the latter form of traffic regulation would be seen as an imposition coming from external sources and discourages such imposition in favour of people coming to their equations over how traffic is best regulated in a space.",

This “humanization” of the road then frees up space for non-traffic functions.' . Further it seeks to foster 'civility and interaction' between different modes of transport (vehicles, bikes, cars etc.) and encourage communication through 'social cues rather than assigning right-of-way to one mode over another'. This definition suggests that the idea of Shared Space want to put traffic control within the ambit of the people who make the traffic rather than depend on an external bodies, such as those that come from law or administrative bodies that structure the use of space currently. Under this reasoning, the latter form of traffic regulation would be seen as an imposition coming from external sources and discourages such imposition in favour of people coming to their decisions over how traffic is best regulated in a space.",

The PPS also suggests that Shared spaces also hark back to a 19th Century practice where streets were a 'coherent scheme' as opposed to the subsequent promotion of motor vehicles and their freedom of movement, that led to severe restrictions on the ability of a pedestrian to move across the streets.",

A study done in the University of West Virginia's downtown campus also supports this observation. The conversion of a busy pedestrian crossing to a Shared Space saw the vehicle travel times cut down by more than 50%. This indicates faster rather than slower cars. ",

The issue that arises then, is that the pedestrian and the vehicle driver are anyway part of an unfair equation, which plays itself out even more unequally when the limited protections that external regulations offer the former are taken away. This would be supported by the fact that vehicles seem to take the lack of regulation as an encouragement to go faster, as shown by the evidence above. The shared understanding reached is one where the vehicle driver continues to emphasise their superior status on the road, justified by how urban plans are generally skewed in their favour.",
