                <h2>Instructions for study participants</h2>
                <p>Thank you for participating in this study! Make sure you follow these steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Complete this <a href="https://standrews.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9tYNKrCBK8uHOiV">short demographics questionnaire</a> if you haven't already. 
                        It should take no more than 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Try out Write Reason. Please <b>watch the “how to use” video on the main page</b>, and try out the tool, and <b>test
                    out saving and exporting your project</b>. If you’re unsure how anything works, or have any other questions, email us
                    at <a href={'mailto:' + emailAddress + '?subject=Write Reason question'}>{emailAddress}</a>.</li>
                    <li>Work on the assignment and <b>record each session in the diary</b>. You can use Write Reason, or any other tool you like 
                        (digital or otherwise). Please record every session you work on the assignment in the diary. The diary is a spreadsheet
                         which tells you what to record. <a href='/diary_template.csv' download>Download the diary template here.</a> If
                          you forget to record a session, make sure you go back and add it in when you realise!</li>
                    <li> Once you've finished the assignment, submit it to CourseSpaces as usual. You can copy and paste your Write Reason project into the required Word document template.
                         In addition, please <b>save the following files to your computer</b>:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>A PDF of your final submission generated by Write Reason</b>. Open your Write Reason project, and click the “Export PDF” button in
                                 the bottom right. Note that the contents of this PDF should match your assignment submission. If you didn’t use Write Reason
                                  in your final session working on the assignment, just copy and paste the contents of your submission into Write Reason, and
                                   generate a PDF using the “Export PDF” button. Don’t worry if the formatting isn’t quite right, we are just looking at the textual content.</li>
                            <li><b>The logs from your Write Reason project</b>. Open your project, and click the “Export Logs” button in the bottom right. This will download a JSON 
                                file to your downloads folder.</li>
                            <li><b>Your completed diary</b>, based on the <a href='/diary_template.csv' download>spreadsheet template</a>.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Once the assignment has been completed, you will be invited to an interview over Teams. At the interview, we will ask you to send us these documents, 
                        so it’s important that you keep them stored on your computer until then.
