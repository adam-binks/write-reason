The shared space schemes within the town of Poynton chose to implement the shared space scheme through the removal of traffic signals, pedestrian guard-railing and junction markings, choosing to replace these forms of signage with double roundel arrangements of two overlapping circles, outlined using contrasting colours of block paving. Slightly upstanding kerbs were elected to separate the pedestrian areas from the carriageway. \\n\\n## No\\nUpon further inspection, there seems to be a myriad of reasons for which shared spaces may not necessarily be viewed as the best amendment to the way streets currently operate. The first example of this would be a factoid from the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea, whose statistics indicate that the average speed of vehicles in the Exhibition Road shared space in South Kensington has increased by 5mph (from 22mph in 2013 to 27mph). This increased speed has been described as \\"lethal\\" by Paralympic swimming gold medallist Lord Holmes. \\n\\nAdditionally, comments by specific user groups can indicate that these forms of shared spaces may leave certain groups feeling vulnerable and threatened. A quote from Michael Broderick that says \\"As a person with Cerebral Palsy who walks with crutches and who had previously fallen in a roadway years ago, shared space schemes terrify me. With traditional roadway schemes and traffic lights or zebra crossings I have always had a level of comfort that\u2014despite my disability\u2014I have time to get across the road and that I will be seen. With shared space, I have no comfort. I have fear. I am a proud disabled man. I am not a second class citizen. But shared space schemes certainly make me feel like one.\u201d illustrates this perfectly, as the shared space scheme seems to not account for user groups that benefit from clearly defined pedestrian zones and feel that they are not at the mercy of individuals\' interpretation and adherence to social cues geared toward road safety. \\n\\nFurthermore, when we examine the redesign of streets & their operations in the 20th century, we can determine that the unrestricted flow of traffic, higher speeds and more motorized traffic (as a result of the car) had become the norm, and traffic engineers needed to account for this increased danger on the road. Hence, safer infrastructure was introduced in the form of separation of road users, specifically through the use of road markings and signs dividing the street, and cobblestones becoming asphalt or concrete. Crosswalks highlighted where pedestrians could safely cross the street, effectively also banning them from crossing at any other space. Shared spaces seem to go back on this form of infrastructure safety and the removal of kerbing, a common element on shared space design, seem to cause specific problems in terms of losing the sense of \\"safe\\" space, specifically by parents of young children, who have taught these children to walk on pavements and stop on curbs. An anecdote by a concerned parent denoted that \\"When I was walking with my young children who were taught to walk on pavement and stop at a curb I almost lost my young daughter who ran into the path of a large car which appeared not to moderate its speed to accommodate the shared space.\u201d, thereby illustrating the dangers of shared spaces for children who may not necessarily know how to follow the \'social cues\' of a shared space and may put themselves in harm\'s way, or road users who may choose to not accommodate the needs of other road users, thereby increasing the danger of shared spaces. \\n\\n## Yes\\nThere are a few reasons why shared spaces in urban planning should be promoted. As mentioned in the support article, the reduced traffic signage and markings will allow for these newly freed spaces to be allocated toward non-traffic functions, thereby reducing motor vehicles\' monopoly on road access and promoting consideration and mindfulness between pedestrians and those in vehicles.

Hence, safer infrastructure was introduced in the form of separation of road users, specifically through the use of road markings and signs dividing the street, and cobblestones becoming asphalt or concrete.

Shared spaces seem to go back on this form of infrastructure safety and the removal of kerbing, a common element on shared space design, seem to cause specific problems in terms of losing the sense of \\"safe\\" space, specifically by parents of young children, who have taught these children to walk on pavements and stop on curbs. An anecdote by a concerned parent denoted that \\"When I was walking with my young children who were taught to walk on pavement and stop at a curb I almost lost my young daughter who ran into the path of a large car which appeared not to moderate its speed to accommodate the shared space.\u201d, thereby illustrating the dangers of shared spaces for children who may not necessarily know how to follow the \'social cues\' of a shared space and may put themselves in harm\'s way, or road users who may choose to not accommodate the needs of other road users, thereby increasing the danger of shared spaces.
