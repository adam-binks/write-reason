According to the Dutch Institute for Road Safety Research, shared spaces are meant to make traffic a \\"guest\\" of public spaces whose \u201clayout should clearly indicate that the primary function of the area is residential\\". \\n\\nA recent implementation of such shared spaces took place in Poynton where, as stated by the council, \\"all traffic signals, pedestrian guardrailing, and road markings from the junction\\" were removed. \\"In its place a double roundel arrangement of two overlapping circles was outlined using contrasting colours of block paving, with only kerbs of a slight upstand separating the pedestrian areas from the carriageway\\". A study by the Urban Design Group suggests that such a scheme has been successful, given that vehicles\' speed was effectively reduced alongside the risk of serious and lethal road injuries.\\n\\nIn addition to safety, shared spaces also seem to have a positive effect on traffic congestion. A study on a crossing location on West Virginia University\'s Downtown campus, realised with Vissim traffic microsimulation software, showed that shared space can reduce vehicle travel time by up to 50% and delays by 66%, which has significant positive economic consequences.\\n\\nThese positive results in terms of both safety and traffic flows, however, seem to be contradicted by a study based on South Kensington\'s Exhibition Road shared space, where the average speed of vehicles has increased from 22mph to 27mph since the introduction of the shared space model. This has obvious consequences on the safety of pedestrians\u2014as paralimpic swimmer gold medallist Lord Holmes put it, such an increase in average speed is \\"lethal\\". Similar concerns around safety seem to depend on the very appearance of a shared spaces, and on  pedestrians\' difficulty in adapting to new urban environments. \\n\\nThe Holmes Report, for example, continues by highlighting how children, who are taught to stay on pavements for their own safety, struggle to identify the dangers of the vehicles\' share of the space and risk running straight onto the road. In a similar vein, the Women and Equalities Committee Report discloses that individuals who identify as disabled may have difficulties in feeling at ease in such spaces where visibility and clarity of signage are reduced, which suggests that shared spaced might have a discriminatory effect on vulnerable users. \\n\\nOverall, users\' perception of shared spaces seems to be overwhelmingly negative, with the Holmes Report on Shared Space claiming that, \\"when asked to rate their experience of a shared space, 63 per cent of the sample rated it as poor, 19 per cent as fair and 18 per cent as good\\".\\n\\nIn conclusion, the data presented here suggests that shared spaces do not have the positive effects they were hoped to have and should therefore not be promoted. It is worth noting, however, that the criteria used in the studies might be flawed and could have affected their results. The Urban Design Group, for example, reasonably points out that critiques based on the most vulnerable users\' issues with these spaces might neglect the positive feedback of a more generic sample. On the other hand, however, the  measurement of safety levels in these reports\u2014one of the main driving forces in the establishment of new shared spaces\u2014depends on the number of incidents reported to the police which, as pointed out by the Holmes Report, only account for the 11% of total incidents. The perceived safety of shared spaces could thus be overestimated. For all this reason, the author of this essay still recommends that shared spaces should not be promoted in urban planning.\\n\\n","timestamp":"2020-07-27T10:50:04.352Z"}],"node_create":[{"type":"node_create","id":1,"timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:08:40.013Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":2,"timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:09:04.593Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":3,"timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:14:37.936Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":4,"timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:15:36.046Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":5,"timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:16:10.709Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":6,"timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:18:15.426Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":7,"timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:18:37.502Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":8,"timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:19:36.495Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":9,"timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:20:43.392Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":10,"timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:22:41.809Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":11,"timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:23:25.344Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":12,"timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:24:00.826Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":13,"timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:24:50.899Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":14,"timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:25:41.652Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":15,"timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:26:39.076Z"}],"node_delete":[{"type":"node_delete","id":1,"timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:08:47.191Z"},{"type":"node_delete","id":3,"timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:15:17.478Z"},{"type":"node_delete","id":6,"timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:18:34.634Z"}],"node_edit_short_text":[{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":2,"text":"Should \u201cshared spaces\u201d in urban planning be promoted?","timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:09:12.093Z"},{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":2,"text":"Shared spaces","timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:15:26.736Z"},{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":4,"text":"Poynton","timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:15:48.143Z"},{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":5,"text":"Holmes report: 63% poor, 19% fair, 18% good","timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:17:01.568Z"},{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":7,"text":"Shared space can reduce vehicle travel time by up to 50% and delays by 66%.","timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:18:41.887Z"},{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":8,"text":"Project for public spaces: definition","timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:19:44.295Z"},{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":9,"text":"Kensington: from 22mph to 27mph","timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:21:00.022Z"},{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":10,"text":"Lack of kerbing dangerous for children","timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:22:50.886Z"},{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":11,"text":"UK dept for transport","timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:23:31.296Z"},{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":12,"text":"Women and equalities committee","timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:24:07.005Z"},{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":13,"text":"Dutch institute","timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:24:54.996Z"},{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":14,"text":"Urban design group","timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:25:46.259Z"},{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":15,"text":"Use of police reports to evaluate viability of SS","timestamp":"2020-07-22T16:27:13.582Z"},{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":4,"text":"Poynton (specific example)","timestamp":"2020-07-27T09:53:31.458Z"}],"paste":[{"type":"paste","paste_type":"html","content":"","content_html":"<meta charset=\'utf-8\'>Urban Design Group\\nOne of the objectives of Shared Schemes is to reduce vehicle speeds to below a level where they are capable\\nof inflicting serious and fatal injuries on vulnerable road users.
