At the same time, the scientific phenomenon of genetic biohacking has emerged in recent years, primarily among private individuals and groups who conduct such experiments on organisms\' genetic biomatter with little to no oversight from a collective regulatory body. Greater regulatory control over biohacking is very much needed, for the safety of the environment, the individuals being tested upon, and, if nothing else, to protect the sacred material which constitutes the foundations of intelligent life.","marks":[]}]},{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"New technology like biohacking is an enormous responsibility; in wrong or irresponsible hands, its ramifications could be catastrophic. History has shown a potential for long-term, detrimental impacts that occur when new technology is left unregulated and uninhibited in the hands of profit-seeking individuals. The development of plastics in the mid-twentieth century serves as one example; once an exciting new technology, plastic has now totally and thoroughly infiltrated the world, on quite a literal level; apart from our heavy economic and daily reliance upon the material, microplastics can even be found in our drinking water.","marks":[]}]},{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"Without an objective third party to regulate experiments and new developments occurring in this field, there is nothing to stand in the way of private corporations or individuals from wreaking havoc on, say, biodiversity and small-scale agriculture, as was discussed in a March 2015 report from the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. Unchecked experiments in biohacking have already led to the development of knockoff gene therapy drugs, which become a concern when safety is being fudged for the sake of cost. If regulators cannot control such production, these cheaper drugs could make it to the market and potentially endanger those who take them. Lengthy testing does cost more, but in most cases it is undertaken for the welfare of those using the drugs and is more beneficial to them in the long term than are slashed prices.","marks":[]}]},{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"However, it can also be argued that increased regulation could lengthen research and development processes and hinder the ability of those who could benefit from such treatment to receive it. In a world where medicine has come so far and such advancements seem possible, it can be frustrating for immediate benefits and results to be postponed by the weights of bureaucracy. However, the fact that the technology for such treatments is available is momentous in itself, a testament to modern progress which should not be taken lightly. In that, technology like biohacking is a huge responsibility. Biohacking interferes with the genome, \'the very essence of life\', and thus a simple mistake could be catastrophic. It is far more prudent to take the time to develop and understand such technology, and ensure the safety of its application, than to rush into it simply for the sake of progress.","marks":[]}]},{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"Furthermore, DNA and genetic coding themselves are not even fully understood.

The responsible, the human thing to do is to approach biohacking\'s capabilities with caution, and to do so critically and fairly requires some sort of regulatory body that can oversee experiments and ensure that due caution is being taken.\\n\\nOverall, any hypothetical regulations must be a collaboration between scientists and government regulators in order to create an effective set of guidelines that allow biohacking technology to be developed freely, but without harming the organisms being tested upon. Many biohackers who do such work on their own are already a part of such discussions in the communities in which they operate, and are therefore well-positioned to enable such collaboration to take place. Many have already welcomed this cooperation and are open to these conversations taking place; all that is needed is for the time to be taken to create effective, well-defined policies and procedures on an official and widespread scale.\\n\\nThus, regulated biohacking of course does not mean no biohacking at all; it merely means that the technology receives proper attention and care to ensure that its potential for disaster is limited as much as possible and prevent irreversible damage before it ever even occurs\\n\\n","timestamp":"2020-07-30T18:12:41.498Z"}],"node_create":[{"type":"node_create","id":1,"timestamp":"2020-07-25T14:54:22.602Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":2,"timestamp":"2020-07-25T15:00:50.037Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":3,"timestamp":"2020-07-25T15:01:09.353Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":4,"timestamp":"2020-07-25T15:03:32.679Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":5,"timestamp":"2020-07-25T15:05:12.144Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":6,"timestamp":"2020-07-25T15:06:15.358Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":7,"timestamp":"2020-07-25T15:07:13.122Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":8,"timestamp":"2020-07-26T19:12:41.520Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":9,"timestamp":"2020-07-26T19:14:52.830Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":10,"timestamp":"2020-07-26T19:15:14.724Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":11,"timestamp":"2020-07-26T19:16:40.367Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":12,"timestamp":"2020-07-26T19:17:58.729Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":13,"timestamp":"2020-07-26T19:18:29.176Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":14,"timestamp":"2020-07-26T19:19:10.588Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":15,"timestamp":"2020-07-26T19:28:07.097Z"},{"type":"node_create","id":16,"timestamp":"2020-07-26T19:32:26.718Z"}],"node_edit_short_text":[{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":1,"text":"Should greater regulatory control be exerted over genetic biohacking?","timestamp":"2020-07-25T14:54:25.704Z"},{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":2,"text":"\\"We could have an accident occur with gene editing that is catastrophic, since the genome isthe very essence of life.\u201d","timestamp":"2020-07-25T15:00:54.043Z"},{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":3,"text":"YES","timestamp":"2020-07-25T15:01:11.071Z"},{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":2,"text":"\\"We could have an accident occur with gene editing that is catastrophic, since the genome is the very essence of life.\u201d","timestamp":"2020-07-25T15:01:37.438Z"},{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":4,"text":"collaboration between scientists and government regulators to create an effective set of regulations that allow the technology to be developed without potentially harming those at the receiving end of the new tech","timestamp":"2020-07-25T15:04:40.572Z"},{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":5,"text":"\\"Given that many biohackers who conduct work at home are also members of community labs,their safety policies have the potential to go a long way in promoting safety in genetic biohacking.","timestamp":"2020-07-25T15:05:16.173Z"},{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":5,"text":"\\"Given that many biohackers who conduct work at home are also members of community labs,their safety policies have the potential to go a long way in promoting safety in genetic biohacking.\\"","timestamp":"2020-07-25T15:05:23.158Z"},{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":6,"text":"biohacking obviously has many benefits waiting to be explored","timestamp":"2020-07-25T15:06:33.155Z"},{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":7,"text":"\\"Cooperation with law-enforcement agencies was welcomed by many biohackers, and itwas generally concluded that the development of material that could be used in bioterrorism was extremelyunlikely.\\"","timestamp":"2020-07-25T15:07:19.405Z"},{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":7,"text":"\\"Cooperation with law-enforcement agencies was welcomed by many biohackers, and it was generally concluded that the development of material that could be used in bioterrorism was extremely unlikely.\\"","timestamp":"2020-07-25T15:07:29.671Z"},{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":8,"text":"regulations could lengthen processes for development and research and hinder the ability of those who could benefit from such treatment to receive it ","timestamp":"2020-07-26T19:13:40.989Z"},{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":9,"text":"new drugs and medical treatments take a long time to be approved in order to ensure they\'re safe","timestamp":"2020-07-26T19:14:55.344Z"},{"type":"node_edit_short_text","id":10,"text":"in a world where medical treatment has come so far and such feats are possible, it can seem frustrating to wait; however, the fact that the technology for such treatments is available is momentous in itself, a testament to modern progress that should not be taken lightly.
