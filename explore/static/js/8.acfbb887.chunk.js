Only 18 per cents of user rate their experience of space as a good one. The upsides, namely reduced vehicle travel time and delays, are not worth the unshakable sense of danger vulnerable road users have to face in the shared area. A dad with two children has shared his experience on the merit. Children, who aren\'t used to the unconventional pavimentacion have an hard time understanding the rules of the new environment. His younger one ran in the path of a large car, which, once again, was not adhering to the lower speed that it was expected to keep. This sense of a loss of a \\"safe space\\" is again brought up by Michael Broderick, who has Cerebral Palsy. \\"Shared space schemes terrify me\\", he claims, \\"with traditional roadway schemes and traffic\\r lights or zebra crossings I have always had a level of comfort that\u2014despite  my disability\u2014I have time to get \\racross the road and that I will be seen.
