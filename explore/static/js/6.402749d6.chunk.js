As a consequence of the easy access to scientific knowledge in the digital age, and the development of biohacking-related communities caused by it, genetic research and testing is no longer confined to traditional laboratories. \\n\\nThe \\"democratisation\\" of genetic research, however, prompts a multitude of questions over its merits, its safety, and - most controversially - its risks. But is genetic biohacking, in its current and largely unregulated form, a cause for positive change or an oncoming catastrophe?\\n\\nIt\'s safe to say that the majority of biohackers are individuals from qualified backgrounds dissatisfied with the scientific world. Take Josiah Zayner, a shining example; the sluggishness and bureaucracy of traditional medical research led him to try to solve his own health issues through self-experimentation. His treatments were successful, making it hard to doubt his research is a force for good that granted him access to treatments unavailable by any other means. By short-cutting the wait of up to 10 years for drugs to be fully approved, biohacking-produced research such as this can be lifesaving to those with access to it. \\n\\nA similar success story involves the drug Glybera. This $1-mil-per-treatment gene therapy was recreated in an affordable form by biohackers, albeit a form that has received criticism from experts in gene therapy. Developments such as this, which circumvent the many years of traditional scientific testing, can be gamechanging to those suffering from genetic conditions. \\n\\nHearing success stories such as these makes it easy to forget that those slow testing processes have reason to exist.
