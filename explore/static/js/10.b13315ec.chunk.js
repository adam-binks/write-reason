On the other hand, the benefits of biohacking such as the possibility of greater innovation and group action should be taken into account in order to fully answer this question. \\n\\n## Illegitimate trials \\nFirstly we should analyse the impact of the lack of regulation imposed when biohacking occurs. Genetic biohacking often occurs by performing trials outside traditional lab, which may bring into question whether these trial are suitable for scientific purposes. They may not contain the same quality or validity of research found in regulated labs in the world, which may have negative consequences towards patients if these are not performed correctly. This has been emphasised in  recent times, especially as the increase in computer hacking throughout the last few decades has led to a rise in the accessibility of \'biohacking\' to any person. This corresponds with the large availability of computers at cheaper prices, allowing power to be given to a much wider range of people. According to the Science Journal, many people with \'little formal scientific training\' have been able to conduct trials of genetic biohacking . As a result, this increases the danger as there is more chance of trials going seriously wrong.\\n\\n## Misuse of the technology \\nMoreover, it should be viewed that this technology could be misused, especially within the hands of the wrong people. This was analysed by Daniel Gerstein who stated that genetic biohacking could be used as a sort of \'pathogen\' with dangerous capabilities . However, these views were proved wrong in 2009 as biohackers cooperated with the FBI to help them understand the new movement that was occurring.  This resulted in law enforcing agencies deciding that the use of genetic biohacking as a sort of bio-weapon would be very unlikely. \\n\\nAnother concern stated by Gerstein was that the lack of knowledge and safety precautions taken could lead to accidents in gene editing, which would be irreversible to the human body. However, biohacking communities are responding to this by creating their own ethics restrictions to try and prevent any damage to public health through the creation of safety policies. Furthermore, many biohackers are already members of community labs who understand the required safety policies to go ahead with genetic biohacking. \\n\\nHowever, private regulation cannot be viewed as a perfect solution in terms of assessing the risks that could be caused to the public. Private actors often disregard  risks that do not directly harm themselves.

Genetic biohacking often occurs by performing trials outside traditional lab, which may bring into question whether these trial are suitable for scientific purposes. They may not contain the same quality or validity of research found in regulated labs in the world, which may have negative consequences towards patients if these are not performed correctly. This has been emphasised in  recent times, especially as the increase in computer hacking throughout the last few decades has led to a rise in the accessibility of \'biohacking\' to any person. This corresponds with the large availability of computers at cheaper prices, allowing power to be given to a much wider range of people.

On the other hand, the benefits of biohacking such as the possibility of greater innovation and group action should be taken into account in order to fully answer this question. \\n\\n## Illegitimate trials \\nFirstly we should analyse the impact of the lack of regulation imposed when biohacking occurs. Genetic biohacking often occurs by performing trials outside traditional lab, which may bring into question whether these trial are suitable for scientific purposes. They may not contain the same quality or validity of research found in regulated labs in the world, which may have negative consequences towards patients if these are not performed correctly. This has been emphasised in  recent times, especially as the increase in computer hacking throughout the last few decades has led to a rise in the accessibility of \'biohacking\' to any person. This corresponds with the large availability of computers at cheaper prices, allowing power to be given to a much wider range of people. According to the Science Journal, many people with \'little formal scientific training\' have been able to conduct trials of genetic biohacking . As a result, this increases the danger as there is more chance of trials going seriously wrong.\\n\\n## Misuse of the technology \\nMoreover, it should be viewed that this technology could be misused, especially within the hands of the wrong people. This was analysed by Daniel Gerstein who stated that genetic biohacking could be used as a sort of \'pathogen\' with dangerous capabilities . However, these views were proved wrong in 2009 as biohackers cooperated with the FBI to help them understand the new movement that was occurring.  This resulted in law enforcing agencies deciding that the use of genetic biohacking as a sort of bio-weapon would be very unlikely. \\n\\nAnother concern stated by Gerstein was that the lack of knowledge and safety precautions taken could lead to accidents in gene editing, which would be irreversible to the human body. However, biohacking communities are responding to this by creating their own ethics restrictions to try and prevent any damage to public health through the creation of safety policies. Furthermore, many biohackers are already members of community labs who understand the required safety policies to go ahead with genetic biohacking. \\n\\nHowever, private regulation cannot be viewed as a perfect solution in terms of assessing the risks as private actors often disregard risks that do not directly harm themselves. \\n\\n## Less control can allow for more innovation \\nOn the other hand, some people would say that there should be less regulatory control over genetic biohacking. This occurs as less government control can allow for more innovation. More freedom for genetic biohacking could lead to not only more cost effective drugs through more people finding constant ways to improve the experiments but also it can lead to greater group action.

According to the Science Journal, many people with \'little formal scientific training\' have been able to conduct trials of genetic biohacking . As a result, this increases the danger as there is more chance of trials going seriously wrong.\\n\\n## Misuse of the technology \\nMoreover, it should be viewed that this technology could be misused, especially within the hands of the wrong people. This was analysed by Daniel Gerstein who stated that genetic biohacking could be used as a sort of \'pathogen\' with dangerous capabilities . However, these views were proved wrong in 2009 as biohackers cooperated with the FBI to help them understand the new movement that was occurring.  This resulted in law enforcing agencies deciding that the use of genetic biohacking as a sort of bio-weapon would be very unlikely. \\n\\nAnother concern stated by Gerstein was that the lack of knowledge and safety precautions taken could lead to accidents in gene editing, which would be irreversible to the human body.

On the other hand, the benefits of biohacking such as the possibility of greater innovation and group action should be taken into account in order to fully answer this question. \\n\\n## Illegitimate trials \\nFirstly we should analyse the impact of the lack of regulation imposed when biohacking occurs. Genetic biohacking often occurs by performing trials outside traditional lab, which may bring into question whether these trial are suitable for scientific purposes. They may not contain the same quality or validity of research found in regulated labs in the world, which may have negative consequences towards patients if these are not performed correctly. This has been emphasised in  recent times, especially as the increase in computer hacking throughout the last few decades has led to a rise in the accessibility of \'biohacking\' to any person. This corresponds with the large availability of computers at cheaper prices, allowing power to be given to a much wider range of people. According to the Science Journal, many people with \'little formal scientific training\' have been able to conduct trials of genetic biohacking . As a result, this increases the danger as there is more chance of trials going seriously wrong.\\n\\n## Misuse of the technology \\nMoreover, it should be viewed that this technology could be misused, especially within the hands of the wrong people. This was analysed by Daniel Gerstein who stated that genetic biohacking could be used as a sort of \'pathogen\' with dangerous capabilities . However, these views were proved wrong in 2009 as biohackers cooperated with the FBI to help them understand the new movement that was occurring.  This resulted in law enforcing agencies deciding that the use of genetic biohacking as a sort of bio-weapon would be very unlikely. \\n\\nAnother concern stated by Gerstein was that the lack of knowledge and safety precautions taken could lead to accidents in gene editing, which would be irreversible to the human body. However, biohacking communities are responding to this by creating their own ethics restrictions to try and prevent any damage to public health through the creation of safety policies. Furthermore, many biohackers are already members of community labs who understand the required safety policies to go ahead with genetic biohacking. \\n\\nHowever, private regulation cannot be viewed as a perfect solution in terms of assessing the risks as private actors often disregard risks that do not directly harm themselves. \\n\\n## Less control can allow for more innovation \\nOn the other hand, some people would say that there should be less regulatory control over genetic biohacking. This occurs as less government control can allow for more innovation. More freedom for genetic biohacking could lead to not only more cost effective drugs through more people finding constant ways to improve the experiments but also it can lead to greater group action.

They may not contain the same quality or validity of research found in regulated labs in the world, which may have negative consequences towards patients if these are not performed correctly. This has been emphasised in  recent times, especially as the increase in computer hacking throughout the last few decades has led to a rise in the accessibility of \'biohacking\' to any person. This corresponds with the large availability of computers at cheaper prices, allowing power to be given to a much wider range of people. According to the Science Journal, many people with \'little formal scientific training\' have been able to conduct trials of genetic biohacking . As a result, this increases the danger as there is more chance of trials going wrong.\\n\\n## Misuse of the technology \\nMoreove, this technology could be misused, especially within the hands of the wrong people. This was analysed by Daniel Gerstein who stated that genetic biohacking could be used as a sort of \'pathogen\' with dangerous capabilities . However, these views were proved wrong in 2009 as biohackers cooperated with the FBI to help them understand the new movement that was occurring.  This resulted in law enforcing agencies deciding that the use of genetic biohacking as a bio-weapon would be very unlikely. \\n\\nAnother concern stated by Gerstein was that the lack of knowledge and safety precautions taken could lead to accidents in gene editing, which would be irreversible to the human body. However, biohacking communities are responding to this by creating their own ethics restrictions to try and prevent any damage to public health through the creation of safety policies. Furthermore, many biohackers are already members of community labs who understand the required safety policies to go ahead with genetic biohacking. \\n\\nHowever, private regulation cannot be viewed as a perfect solution. Private actors often disregard risks that do not directly harm themselves, which can lead to negative external consequences affecting 3rd parties such as the environment. \\n\\n## Less control can allow for more innovation \\nOn the other hand, some people would say that there should be less regulatory control over genetic biohacking. This occurs as less government control can allow for more innovation. Freedom from government restriction for genetic biohacking could lead to not only more cost effective drugs through more people finding constant ways to improve the experiments but also it can lead to greater group action. This was shown by Matt Might who brought a community of families together to face a rare genetic disease in order to help his son. These groups can increase the resources and abilities to face different challenges and increase the capability for success. \\n\\n## It is still within certain control of the government\\nFurthermore, there is no need for greater regulatory control over genetic biohacking as it is already with the control of the government. Departments such as the FDA can support efforts to increase biohacking, often this occurs through education schemes. This allows biohackers to understand the health risks involved and can allow for increase cooperation between the governments and the people.  \\n\\n## There is too longer timespan for the production and approval of drugs \\nFinally, genetic biohacking freedom is crucial in order to reduce the timespan for the production and approval of drugs that could lead to less unnecessary deaths from patients waiting for medicines that take years to produce. Although the FDA has expressed concerns about the \'do it yourself kits\' and the safety risks involved if they become available to the general public, it should be recalled that people actually deserve the right to experiment on themselves.
