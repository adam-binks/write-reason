According to Scientific American, new forms of participatory health research suffer from a lack of legitimacy, leading to concerns over the scientific validity of the experiments and the subsequent safety of the products of the research. With greater regulatory control, the quality and validity of biohacking research would be uniform, ensuring that resulting therapy and application are completely safe to use. As Daniel Gerstein mentions, biotechnology has the possibility to be misused, which could occur in the absence of sufficient regulatory control. Gerstein also states his organisation\'s concern that a pathogen with robust capabilities could be accidentally developed by amateur biohackers, which could create a catastrophic global crisis.

Although some biohacking communities adopt their own ethics restrictions, a lack of regulation means that there may be a lack of ethical restrictions during trials in biohacking research, since it is left to the scientists themselves to decide on ethical limitations for the extent to which biohacking should and can be taken.","marks":[]}]},{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"","marks":[]}]},{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"On the other hand, the low speed at which trials for gene editing and medical treatments are greenlighted supports the argument that less regulatory control should be exerted. In Josiah Zayner\'s case, the 10-year wait required for new drugs to be developed and approved affected him negatively, since he already had health problems that needed treatment. Although Zayner\'s statement that science should be democratised so that people could experiment on themselves is contradicted by Gerstein\'s view that amateur biohacking could create more problems for society, his statement is supported by the patients that suffer whilst they wait for institutions to approve scientific trials.","marks":[]}]},{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"","marks":[]}]},{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"text","text":"In the case of Glybera, as reported by the MIT Technology Review, independent biohackers are using their biohacking skills for good, supporting the argument that less regulatory control should be exerted on the genetic biohacking community.

Glybera\'s status as the world\'s most expensive drug may either be due to the patent taken out by its creator, or because of the cost needed to develop each dose. No matter the reason for its price tag, Glybera, along with a large number of treatments around the world, are unaffordable for patients who need it.

Gerstein also states his organisation\'s concern that a pathogen with robust capabilities could be accidentally developed by amateur biohackers, which could create a catastrophic global crisis. \\n\\nThere are also ethical concerns regarding biohacking that is in favour of greater regulatory control. As Gerstein mentions, the genome is the \'very essence of life\', and an accident in gene editing could have disastrous results. Although some biohacking communities adopt their own ethics restrictions, a lack of regulation means that there may be a lack of ethical restrictions during trials in biohacking research, since it is left to the scientists themselves to decide on ethical limitations for the extent to which biohacking should and can be taken.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the low speed at which trials for gene editing and medical treatments are greenlighted supports the argument that less regulatory control should be exerted. In Josiah Zayner\'s case, the 10-year wait required for new drugs to be developed and approved affected him negatively, since he already had health problems that needed treatment. Although Zayner\'s statement that science should be democratised so that people could experiment on themselves is contradicted by Gerstein\'s view that amateur biohacking could create more problems for society, his statement is supported by the patients that suffer whilst they wait for institutions to approve scientific trials.\\n\\nIn the case of Glybera, as reported by the MIT Technology Review, independent biohackers are using their biohacking skills for good, supporting the argument that less regulatory control should be exerted on the genetic biohacking community. The international group\'s claim that they are able to copy Glybera, if successful, would be able to treat sufferers of an inherited disease. Glybera\'s status as the world\'s most expensive drug may either be due to the patent taken out by its creator, or because of the cost needed to develop each dose. No matter the reason for its price tag, Glybera, along with a large number of treatments around the world, are unaffordable for patients who need it. Exerting less regulatory control over genetic biohacking would allow amateur biologists to create cheap copies that everyone can access.\\n\\nIn conclusion, although there are risks associated with insufficient regulatory control over genetic biohacking, the benefits of allowing biohackers to develop new treatments outweigh the potential drawbacks of exerting greater regulatory control.

With greater regulatory control, the quality and validity of biohacking research would be uniform, ensuring that resulting therapy and application are completely safe to use.
