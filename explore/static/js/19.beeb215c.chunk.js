This can be either of my own creation, or of others. In my eyes there are two real types of essays; either that which aims to introduce the new or that which critiques the old. These are not mutually exclusive but given word counts it is usually best to pick one of the two and start from there. I aim to produce a product in which the reader can clearly see my contributions and the contributions of others in the correct academic context. \\",\\"q2\\":\\"A good essay first and foremost should be readible. Of course, in specialised subjects this can have a very different meaning but I believe that the target audience should be able to access the text without difficulty. \\\\n\\\\nGood essays offer context, they show you into what environment these ideas are born and discussed. It would be foolish to compare research from 1922 to 2020 without acknowledging the differences and similarities. \\\\n\\\\nGood essays utilise sources well. They don\'t dwell only in the literature, but nor do they ignore it. It is not the amount of literature that matters but how it is utilised.\\",\\"q3\\":\\"The cynic in me wants to answer \\\\\\"obligations\\\\\\", essay assignments have become how academia is done. Most people write to gain a degree, rather than for the sake of writing. Some do write for the joy of it, some write to record information, some write to convince or aruge, some write to gain publications, but I would argue that most essays written are done out of obligation.\\"}","projects":[{"name":"What work should i do?","id":1,"log":{"events":{"session_start":[{"type":"session_start","timestamp":"2020-07-22T13:02:54.615Z"}],"document_content_markdown":[{"type":"document_content_markdown","content":"","timestamp":"2020-07-22T13:03:54.543Z"},{"type":"document_content_markdown","content":"","timestamp":"2020-07-22T13:04:54.527Z"},{"type":"document_content_markdown","content":"","timestamp":"2020-07-22T13:05:54.530Z"},{"type":"document_content_markdown","content":"","timestamp":"2020-07-22T13:06:54.529Z"},{"type":"document_content_markdown","content":"## Should greater regulatory control be exerted over genetic biohacking?\\n","timestamp":"2020-07-22T13:07:54.525Z"},{"type":"document_content_markdown","content":"## Should greater regulatory control be exerted over genetic biohacking?\\n","timestamp":"2020-07-22T13:08:54.538Z"},{"type":"document_content_markdown","content":"## Should greater regulatory control be exerted over genetic biohacking?\\n","timestamp":"2020-07-22T13:09:54.548Z"},{"type":"document_content_markdown","content":"## Should greater regulatory control be exerted over genetic biohacking?\\n","timestamp":"2020-07-22T13:10:54.539Z"},{"type":"document_content_markdown","content":"## Should greater regulatory control be exerted over genetic biohacking?\\n","timestamp":"2020-07-22T13:11:54.544Z"},{"type":"document_content_markdown","content":"## Should greater regulatory control be exerted over genetic biohacking?\\n","timestamp":"2020-07-22T13:12:54.538Z"},{"type":"document_content_markdown","content":"## Should greater regulatory control be exerted over genetic biohacking?\\n","timestamp":"2020-07-22T13:13:54.538Z"},{"type":"document_content_markdown","content":"## Should greater regulatory control be exerted over genetic biohacking?\\n","timestamp":"2020-07-22T13:14:54.542Z"},{"type":"document_content_markdown","content":"## Should greater regulatory control be exerted over genetic biohacking?\\n","timestamp":"2020-07-22T13:15:54.546Z"},{"type":"document_content_markdown","content":"## Should greater regulatory control be exerted over genetic biohacking?\\n","timestamp":"2020-07-22T13:16:54.542Z"},{"type":"document_content_markdown","content":"## Should greater regulatory control be exerted over genetic biohacking?\\n","timestamp":"2020-07-22T13:17:54.548Z"},{"type":"document_content_markdown","content":"## Should greater regulatory control be exerted over genetic biohacking?\\n","timestamp":"2020-07-22T13:18:54.540Z"},{"type":"document_content_markdown","content":"## Should greater regulatory control be exerted over genetic biohacking?\\nBiohacking is a pioneering area of bio-technology which involves the involving \\n\\n","timestamp":"2020-07-22T13:19:54.546Z"},{"type":"document_content_markdown","content":"## Should greater regulatory control be exerted over genetic biohacking?\\nBiohacking is a pioneering area of bio-technology which involves the involving of freelance, or non-institutional research into subjects like genomes.
