A good essay seamlessly guides the reader through the development of the argumentation; it is well structured and signposted making it easy to read.

Writing an essay can also help the writer to clarify their thoughts on a particular issue and help them work out their own position.

Therefore, if an adult wants to experiment with the effects of a particular substance that they believe may benefit their health in some way then they have the right to make this decision and cope with the consequences. However, if a parent was to administer the same substance to their child or a dependent who is unable to make an informed decision for themselves this is very wrong because the child may ultimately have to cope with negative consequences that were not of their own choosing. \\n\\nSimilarly, regulatory control over biohacking may be necessary to protect vulnerable members  of society who are more likely to be exploited by con artists. People with chronic or terminal conditions can become desperate, making them more prone to illogical thinking and putting false hope in \'alternative medicine\'. They can be easy targets for alternative practitioners who often prey on this false hope and in some cases it is arguable whether they may have the mental capacity for consent. Therefore, from this point of view, the state needs regulate biohacking to a greater extent to protect people from false information and potentially  dangerous practises which can cause harm to health and finances. \\n\\nHowever, some may argue that this angle infers the public is weak -minded and needs to be protected from their own fragility and incompetence. This is factually incorrect and  may lead to people feeling misunderstood by the authorities, creating an \'us and them\' dynamic.

Therefore, increased regulation may make the public feel infantalised which adds ammunition to the root cause of tje problem i.e. the reason people reject traditional medicine in the first place. \\n\\nEvidence  to dispute the idea that the public is incompetent when it comes to their own health is the case of Matt Might, the father of a son with a rare genetic condition. He collected information from families of children with similar symptoms and collaborated with doctors to formulate a more concrete diagnosis for his son and others, paving the way for greater understanding and more effective treatment in the future (Scientific American).

However, if a parent was to administer the same substance to their child or a dependent who is unable to make an informed decision for themselves this is very wrong because the child may ultimately have to cope with negative consequences that were not of their own choosing, even if the parent thought they were making the decision in the child\'s best interests. Regulatory controls therefore must be used in this instance. \\n\\nSimilarly, regulatory control over biohacking may be necessary to protect vulnerable members  of society who are more likely to be exploited by con artists. People with chronic or terminal conditions can become desperate, making them more prone to illogical thinking and putting false hope in \'alternative medicine\'. They can be easy targets for alternative practitioners who often prey on this false hope and in some cases it is arguable whether they may have the mental capacity for consent. Therefore, from this point of view, the state needs regulate biohacking to a greater extent to protect people from false information and potentially  dangerous practises which can cause harm to health and finances. \\n\\nHowever, some may argue that this angle infers the public is weak -minded and needs to be protected from their own fragility and incompetence. This is factually incorrect and  may lead to people feeling misunderstood by the authorities, creating an \'us and them\' dynamic. Indeed, a mistrust of authority may be a key reason why people resort to biohacking. Therefore, increased regulation may make the public feel infantalised which adds ammunition to the root cause of the problem i.e. the reason people reject traditional medicine in the first place. \\n\\nEvidence  to dispute the idea that the public is incompetent when it comes to their own health is the case of Matt Might, the father of a son with a rare genetic condition. He collected information from families of children with similar symptoms and collaborated with doctors to formulate a more concrete diagnosis for his son and others, paving the way for greater understanding and more effective treatment in the future (Scientific American). This story shows that the public taking their health into their own hands can lead to important discoveries that will improve public health and/or quality of life for those with chronic (especially rare) conditions. An argument can also be made that individuals with personal experience of these health conditions and their families can be better placed to make these discoveries because they have a more detailed understanding from their day to day experiences as well as the personal motivation for improvement of their own quality of life. In the case of Matt Might, this progress may not have been possible if he had felt alienated by the medical establishment. \\n\\nSimilarly, for those who have felt let down by traditional medicine, restrictions on biohacking may lead to people taking more drastic measures and acceptance of an underground black market biohacking community. This could make biohacking even more dangerous, further increasing its risks. Additionally, if it became associated with criminal behaviour, this would present additional risks for both individual and public health. \\n\\nIn conclusion, although biohacking presents a danger to public health, imposing tighter regulatory controls  is unlikely to reduce these risks and as discussed, may have the opposite effect. However, there must be an exception to this for biohacking by proxy in the cases of children or adults with incapacity. In general, the need to resort to biohacking to improve one\'s health indicates a mistrust of conventional evidence based medicine. Therefore, increasing public trust in medical authorities needs to be a priority for governments in order to reduce biohacking and the risks it poses. This may be achieved by increasing transparency  so that the public has access to more information about health boards and pharmaceutical companies. Additionally making healthcare systems more democratic could also help in the longer term by giving patients more of a chance to have a say and see that their opinions have been taken into account where possible in decisions about the running of these services. \\n\\n","timestamp":"2020-07-28T15:52:14.964Z"},{"type":"document_content_markdown","content":"Should greater regulatory control be exerted over genetic bio hacking? \\n\\nBiohacking has been the source of much controversy over recent years  as health related technology has become increasingly available to the public.

However, there must be an exception to this for biohacking by proxy in the cases of children or adults with incapacity. In general, the need to resort to biohacking to improve one\'s health indicates a mistrust of conventional evidence based medicine. Therefore, increasing public trust in medical authorities needs to be a priority for governments in order to reduce biohacking and the risks it poses. This may be achieved by increasing transparency  so that the public has access to more information about health boards and pharmaceutical companies. Additionally making healthcare systems more democratic could also help in the longer term by giving patients more of a chance to have a say and see that their opinions have been taken into account where possible in decisions about the running of these services. In sum, the way forward is for authorities and health professionals to work together with the public, rather than against them.

However, there must be an exception to this for biohacking by proxy in the cases of children or adults with incapacity. In general, the need to resort to biohacking to improve one\'s health indicates a mistrust of conventional evidence based medicine. Therefore, increasing public trust in medical authorities needs to be a priority for governments in order to reduce biohacking and the risks it poses. This may be achieved by increasing transparency  so that the public has access to more information about health boards and pharmaceutical companies. Additionally making healthcare systems more democratic could also help in the longer term by giving patients more of a chance to have a say and see that their opinions have been taken into account where possible in decisions about the running of these services. In sum, the way forward is for authorities and health professionals to work together with the public, rather than against them.
