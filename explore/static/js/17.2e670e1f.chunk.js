Naturally, the complexity gap between bacteria and humans cannot be mitigated. The widespread effect of wide-spread gene editing on a developed adult human is unexplored. Importantly, this is not because the insights would be neglible or disasterious, but rather it has been determined that it is \'ethically wrong\'. This pontification neglects the collosal benefits that will arise from a safe applicable of gene editing.

In spite of the detractors and critics, Werner For\xdfmann decided, in 1929, to successfully perform the procedure on himself to evaluate and improve its safety so that it could be widely applied. The vigilantism of current hobbyists in genetic biohacking may join For\xdfmann in producing astounding, sought-after, and remarkable advances in science for the benefit of us all, much to the infuriation of sound inane ethicists. Already, biohacking has led to advances in our understanding of rare muscular diseases much neglected by established pharma and science. Consequently, biohackers, like computer hackers before, have begun to equalise information and benefits once restrain by established authority to the benefit of us all. \\n\\nCritics and disparagers voice that the more likely harms than benefits afforded to the individual and questions of bioweapon production - accidental or deliberate - with the existential risks it affords means regulation is essential. The question immediately becomes, what would this regulation look like? Would it be oversight, restricted permits, or outright banning? In each of these cases, not only does it obliterate the principle of self-determination but extinguishes all of the benefits that can be acquired by genetic biohacking as we conceive it today. Firstly, any degree of oversight, if enforced for the sake of protection of the individual, will naturally limit the extent an individual can perform genetic modifications on themselves. From this it follows that, as the most benefit is extracted by the riskier and untried modifications, the benefits would be obliterated. In all probability, the hobbyist would be unable to extend insights further than the qualified scientific community as more regulation suggests that the regulations banning human-related genetic modification research would persist. On a side note, it is worthy to consider that it is much better to be in the arena, influencing the direction of game, than outside, spectating. In other words, as states like China are already openly using CRISPR in embryo research to great improve our understanding of health (see HIV immunity), taking any moral highground would forefit the persistence of the research one finds morally repugnant or unacceptable, thus concluding that one\'s rejection of the research, and thus lack of ability to make it less wrong, is morally unacceptable in itself! Secondly, even in the most extreme case of outright banning, the most hineous aspects of genetic modification - namely bioweapon formation - would probably persist as the individuals performing this research are likely unaffected by the expatiating state. Therefore, only the very worst bioweapon research would persist and all the benefit, yet rare, hobbyist research would be lost to the weight of ill-concieved regulation. \\n\\n To conclude, genetic biohacking can have deadly consequences for the individual and society. However, the harms that exist because of genetic engineering persists despite even the most austere regulation. Rather, allowing open access to the fruits of science to all people irrespective of status can have benefits, especially to those individuals with diseases traditionally ignored by profit-seeking pharmaceutical companies and grant-restricted research labratories. \\n\\n","timestamp":"2020-09-24T15:21:01.399Z"},{"type":"document_content_markdown","content":"Should greater regulatory control be exerted over genetic biohacking?\\n\\nGenetic biohacking - the use of gene-editing technology like CRISPR on oneself - could be the greatest technological equaliser since the advent of the world wide web however, like its technological predecessors, its future is threatened by supressive regulation conjured from scant scaremonging.

In each of these cases, not only does it obliterate the principle of self-determination but extinguishes all of the benefits that can be acquired by genetic biohacking as we conceive it today. Firstly, any degree of oversight, if enforced for the sake of protection of the individual, will naturally limit the extent an individual can perform genetic modifications on themselves. From this it follows that, as the most benefit is extracted by the riskier and untried modifications, the benefits would be obliterated.

In other words, as states like China are already openly using CRISPR in embryo research to great improve our understanding of health (see HIV immunity), taking any moral highground would forefit the persistence of the research one finds morally repugnant or unacceptable, thus concluding that one\'s rejection of the research, and thus lack of ability to make it less wrong, is morally unacceptable in itself! Secondly, even in the most extreme case of outright banning, the most hineous aspects of genetic modification - namely bioweapon formation - would probably persist as the individuals performing this research are likely unaffected by the expatiating state.

In each of these cases, not only does it obliterate the principle of self-determination but extinguishes all of the benefits that can be acquired by genetic biohacking as we conceive it today. Firstly, any degree of oversight, if enforced for the sake of protection of the individual, will naturally limit the extent an individual can perform genetic modifications on themselves. From this it follows that, as the most benefit is extracted by the riskier and untried modifications, the benefits would be obliterated. In all probability, the hobbyist would be unable to extend insights further than the qualified scientific community as more regulation suggests that the regulations banning human-related genetic modification research would persist. On a side note, it is worthy to consider that it is much better to be in the arena, influencing the direction of game, than outside, spectating - particularly if you care about the game\'s outcome. In other words, as states like China are already openly using CRISPR in embryo research to greatly improve our understanding of health (see HIV immunity), taking any moral highground would forefit the persistence of a rendition of research that one finds morally repugnant or unacceptable. Thus, concluding that one\'s rejection of the research, and thus lack of ability to make it less wrong, is morally unacceptable in itself! Secondly, even in the most extreme case of outright banning, the most hineous aspects of genetic modification - namely bioweapon formation - would probably persist as the individuals performing this research are likely unaffected by the expatiating state. Therefore, only the very worst bioweapon research would persist and all the benefit, yet rare, hobbyist research would be lost to the weight of ill-concieved regulation. \\n\\nTo conclude, genetic biohacking can have deadly consequences for the individual and society.

Should we enable the polar extremes: complete freedom from consequence or deontological totality? Naturally, the vast majority of us would reasonable conclude the best option lies between these two extremes. Genetic biohacking falls into the category of self-harm; does the state have the moral juristiction to command how a person interacts with themselves? Is it the state\'s perogative to monitor and control self-interaction: from the thoughts and ideas we believe to the type of tattoo we paint on ourselves? To answer these boundary cases, we simply have to consider the purpose of the state\'s existence (presuming we entertain that it should exist at all!). A reasonable starting assertion to promulgate is that the state\'s role is to maximise the life and freedom of each of its citizens; the state punishes insurrection that tries to diminish the life and freedom of others. Therefore, the stage is set for our discussion for genetic biohacking.

Naturally, the complexity gap between bacteria and humans cannot be mitigated. The widespread effect of wide-spread gene editing on a developed adult human is unexplored. Importantly, this is not because the insights would be neglible or disasterious, but rather it has been determined that it is \'ethically wrong\'. This pontification neglects the collosal benefits that will arise from a safe applicable of gene editing. However, to trek from unsafe to safe in science naturally requires an individual to shoulder the burden of risk. Think, at one point in time cardiac catheterisation was deemed to dangerous to be even attempted, despite its obvious power as a tool for saving life through diagnosis cardiac diease. In spite of the detractors and critics, Werner For\xdfmann decided, in 1929, to successfully perform the procedure on himself to evaluate and improve its safety so that it could be widely applied. The vigilantism of current hobbyists in genetic biohacking may join For\xdfmann in producing astounding, sought-after, and remarkable advances in science for the benefit of us all, much to the infuriation of inane ethicists. Already, biohacking has led to advances in our understanding of rare muscular diseases much neglected by established pharma and science. Consequently, biohackers, like computer hackers before, have begun to equalise information and benefits once restrain by established authority to the benefit of us all.

The question immediately becomes, what would this regulation look like? Would it be oversight, restricted permits, or outright banning? In each of these cases, not only does it obliterate the principle of self-determination but extinguishes all of the benefits that can be acquired by genetic biohacking as we conceive it today. Firstly, any degree of oversight, if enforced for the sake of protection of the individual, will naturally limit the extent an individual can perform genetic modifications on themselves. From this it follows that, as the most benefit is extracted by the riskier and untried modifications, the benefits would be obliterated. In all probability, the hobbyist would be unable to extend insights further than the qualified scientific community as more regulation suggests that the regulations banning human-related genetic modification research would persist. On a side note, it is worthy to consider that it is much better to be in the arena, influencing the direction of game, than outside, spectating - particularly if you care about the game\'s outcome. In other words, as states like China are already openly using CRISPR in embryo research to greatly improve our understanding of health (see HIV immunity), taking any moral highground would forefit the persistence of a rendition of research that one finds morally repugnant or unacceptable. Thus, concluding that one\'s rejection of the research, and thus lack of ability to make it less wrong, is morally unacceptable in itself! Secondly, even in the most extreme case of outright banning, the most hineous aspects of genetic modification - namely bioweapon formation - would probably persist as the individuals performing this research are likely unaffected by the expatiating state. Therefore, only the very worst bioweapon research would persist and all the benefit, yet rare, hobbyist research would be lost to the weight of ill-concieved regulation.

However, the harms that exist because of genetic engineering persists despite even the most austere regulation.

Even if this putative benefit is diminishingly small, the principle of self-determination stands. Who are we as an individual, or even a collection of individuals holding a state emblem, to restrain another\'s form? To disregard this principle and favour state-determined personal destiny opens a slippy slope to a dystopia.

Genetic biohacking falls into the category of self-harm; does the state have the moral jurisdiction to command how a person interacts with themselves? Is it the state\'s prerogative to monitor and control self-interaction: from the thoughts and ideas we believe in the type of tattoo we paint on ourselves? To answer these boundary cases, we simply have to consider the purpose of the state\'s existence (presuming we entertain that it should exist at all!). A reasonable starting assertion to promulgate is that the state\'s role is to maximise the life and freedom of each of its citizens; the state punishes insurrection that tries to diminish the life and freedom of others.

Importantly, this is not because the insights would be negligible or disastrous, but rather it has been determined that it is \'ethically wrong\'. This pontification neglects the colossal benefits that will arise from a safe applicable of gene editing. However, to trek from unsafe to safe in science naturally requires an individual to shoulder the burden of risk. Think, at one point in time cardiac catheterisation was deemed too dangerous to be even attempted, despite its obvious power as a tool for saving a life through diagnosis cardiac disease. In spite of the detractors and critics, Werner For\xdfmann decided, in 1929, to successfully perform the procedure on himself to evaluate and improve its safety so that it could be widely applied. The vigilantism of current hobbyists in genetic biohacking may join For\xdfmann in producing astounding, sought-after, and remarkable advances in science for the benefit of us all, much to the infuriation of inane ethicists. Already, biohacking has led to advances in our understanding of rare muscular diseases much neglected by established pharma and science.

The question immediately becomes, what would this regulation look like? Would it be oversight, restricted permits, or outright banning? In each of these cases, not only does it obliterate the principle of self-determination but extinguishes all of the benefits that can be acquired by genetic biohacking as we conceive it today. Firstly, any degree of oversight, if enforced for the sake of protection of the individual, will naturally limit the extent an individual can perform genetic modifications on themselves. From this, it follows that, as the most benefit is extracted by the riskier and untried modifications, the benefits would be obliterated. In all probability, the hobbyist would be unable to extend insights further than the qualified scientific community as more regulation suggests that the regulations banning human-related genetic modification research would persist. On a side note, it is worthy to consider that it is much better to be in the arena, influencing the direction of the game, than outside, spectating - particularly if you care about the game\'s outcome. In other words, as states like China are already openly using CRISPR in embryo research to greatly improve our understanding of health (see HIV immunity), taking any moral high ground would forfeit the persistence of a rendition of research that one finds morally repugnant or unacceptable. Thus, concluding that one\'s rejection of the research, and thus lack of ability to make it less wrong, is morally unacceptable in itself! Secondly, even in the most extreme case of outright banning, the most heinous aspects of genetic modification - namely bioweapon formation - would probably persist as the individuals performing this research are likely unaffected by the expatiating state. Therefore, only the very worst bioweapon research would persist and all the benefit, yet rare, hobbyist research would be lost to the weight of ill-conceived regulation.
