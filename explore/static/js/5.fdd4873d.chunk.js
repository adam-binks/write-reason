Motorists cannot be trusted to be considerate to pedestrians or to obey speed laws when rules are relaxed, as they are in \\"shared space\\" urban designs. In South Kensington, in Exhibition Road, since introducing a shared space between vehicles and pedestrians, the average vehicle speed has increased from 22mph  to 27 mph. This very clearly shows that motorists cannot be trusted to be considerate of pedestrians, especially when the rules are relaxed. Motorists are taking advantage of these \\"shared spaces\\" by driving more quickly, which is putting pedestrians at risk. Furthermore, \\"shared spaces\\" by design reduce the separation between pedestrians and the road. In Poynton, one such \\"shared space\\" involves only a slight upward kerb between the road and the walkway, which poses extreme safety risks for walking in the dark, pedestrians with sight and mobility issues and young children.

With shared space I have no comfort. I have fear. I am a proud disabled man. I am not a second class citizen. But shared space schemes certainly make me feel like one.\u201d The Urban Design Group have rejected such qualms, stating that \\"... the best design is necessarily one that focuses on the needs of the most vulnerable user group. It is crucial that the design of public realm is not skewed to any particular user group as this will adversely affect others and produce bad design.\\" This stance, taken by the Urban Design Group is disproportionately negatively impacting on disabled pedestrians.

In South Kensington, in Exhibition Road, since introducing a shared space between vehicles and pedestrians, the average vehicle speed has increased from 22mph  to 27 mph. This very clearly shows that motorists cannot be trusted to be considerate of pedestrians, especially when the rules are relaxed. Motorists are taking advantage of these \\"shared spaces\\" by driving more quickly, which is putting pedestrians at risk. Furthermore, \\"shared spaces\\" by design reduce the separation between pedestrians and the road. In Poynton, one such \\"shared space\\" involves only a slight upward kerb between the road and the walkway, which poses extreme safety risks for walking in the dark, pedestrians with sight and mobility issues and young children. Compromises to the safety of pedestrians that are required for \\"shared space\\" urban areas are simply unacceptable.\\n\\n\\"Shared spaces\\" have proven to be especially unsafe for disabled pedestrians. Michael Broderick: \u201cAs a person with Cerebral Palsy who walks with crutches and who had previously fallen in a roadway years ago, shared space schemes terrify me. With traditional roadway schemes and traffic lights or zebra crossings I have always had a level of comfort that\u2014despite my disability\u2014I have time to get across the road and that I will be seen. With shared space I have no comfort. I have fear. I am a proud disabled man. I am not a second class citizen. But shared space schemes certainly make me feel like one.\u201d The Urban Design Group have rejected such qualms, stating that \\"... the best design is necessarily one that focuses on the needs of the most vulnerable user group.

This very clearly shows that motorists cannot be trusted to be considerate of pedestrians, especially when the rules are relaxed. Motorists are taking advantage of these \\"shared spaces\\" by driving more quickly, which is putting pedestrians at risk. Furthermore, \\"shared spaces\\" by design reduce the separation between pedestrians and the road. In Poynton, one such \\"shared space\\" involves only a slight upward kerb between the road and the walkway, which poses extreme safety risks for walking in the dark, pedestrians with sight and mobility issues and young children.
