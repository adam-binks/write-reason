Write Reason is a tool for planning and writing documents. In the left pane is a text editor. In the right pane is a free-form mapping interface. You can link parts of these two panes together, and their contents will stay synchronised.

Write Reason was built using [React](https://reactjs.org/), with [Slate.js](slatejs.org) for the text editor and [SVG.js](https://github.com/svgdotjs/svg.js) for the map pane.

Write Reason was designed by researchers at the University of St Andrews and the University of Victoria: [Adam Binks](https://adambinks.me), [Alice Toniolo](https://at258.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk) and [Miguel Nacenta](http://nacenta.com/).
